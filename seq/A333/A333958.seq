%N A333958 The number of closed lambda calculus terms of size n that have a normal form, where size(lambda M)=2+size(M), size(M N)=2+size(M)+size(N), and size(V)=1+i for a variable V bound by the i-th enclosing lambda.
%C A333958 This sequence is uncomputable, like the corresponding Busy Beaver sequence A333479, which takes the maximum normal form size of the a(n) terms that have one.
%H A333958 Computed by changing "maximum $ (n,0,P Bot) :" in the main function of this <a href="https://github.com/tromp/AIT/blob/master/BB/BB.lhs">Haskell program for analyzing Busy Beaver numbers</a> to "length".
%e A333958 This sequence first differs from A114852 at n=18 where it excludes the shortest term without a normal form (lambda x. x x)(lambda x. x x), hence a(18) = 298-1 = 297.
%Y A333958 Cf. A114852, A195691, A333479, A004147.
