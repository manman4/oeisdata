%N A333677 Numbers whose divisors can be partitioned into two disjoint sets whose sums are consecutive Fibonacci numbers.
%C A333677 Since the sum of divisors of each term is also a Fibonacci number, this sequence is a subsequence of A272412.
%e A333677 66 is a term since its divisors {1, 2, 3, 6, 11, 22, 33, 66} can be partitioned into the two disjoint sets, {2, 3, 6, 11, 33} and {1, 22, 66}, whose sums, 55 and 89, are 2 consecutive Fibonacci numbers.
