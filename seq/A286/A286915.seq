%N A286915 Primes p such that p+6, p+12, p+18, p+20, p+26, p+32, and p+38 are all primes.
%C A286915 Many, but not all, of the terms are the smallest prime in a sequence of 8 consecutive primes with first differences equal to 6, 6, 6, 2, 6, 6, 6. - _Harvey P. Dale_, May 24 2017
%C A286915 Of the first 400 terms, 311 are the smallest prime in a sequence of 8 consecutive primes with first differences equal to 6, 6, 6, 2, 6, 6, 6. - _Harvey P. Dale_, May 25 2017
%C A286915 All terms are congruent to 11 (mod 30). - _Zak Seidov_, May 24 2017 [Proof: Suppose p == x (mod 30). Then all of x, x+6, x+12, x+18, x+20, x+26, x+2, and x+8 must be relatively prime to 30. This implies x = 11. (We cannot have x=1, for then p+2 would be == 3 (mod 30), we cannot have x=7, for then p+18 would be == 25 (mod 30), and so on.) - _N. J. A. Sloane_, May 24 2017]
