%N A286778 Sum of the common path length over all 2-tuples of nodes in a complete binary tree of height n.
%C A286778 Let the height of the binary tree be one less than the number of rows; i.e., a complete binary tree of height 2 has one root node, its two descends and four leaf nodes. Any node u has a unique path to the root of the binary tree. Let h(u,v) be the length of the intersection of these paths for nodes u and v. Then a(n) is defined to be the sum of h(u,v) over all ordered 2-tuples of nodes in a binary tree of height n.
%C A286778 Also the sum over all 2-tuples of nodes of the depth of their last common ancestor in the tree. Defined in this way and denoted Q(T) in the Janson link.
%C A286778 Let z(v) be the number of nodes in the subtree rooted at node v (so if u is the root z(u) is the number of nodes in the tree). Then a(n) is also the sum of squares of the z(v) over all non-root nodes v in the tree.

%F A286778 a(n) = 4*2^(2*n) - (4*n+2)*2^n - 2.
%F A286778 G.f.: 2*x*(2*x+1)/((4*x-1)*(x-1)*(2*x-1)^2).
%F A286778 E.g.f.: 4*exp(4*x)-(8*x+2)*exp(2*x)-2*exp(x).

%e A286778 A complete binary tree of height two consists of one root node (at depth 0), two children of the root (at depth 1) and four leaf nodes (at depth 2). Notice the common path length of node u with itself, h(u,u), is simply the depth of u.
%e A286778 The only 2-tuples to have common path length two is a leaf with itself (4 such tuples). Each child of the root with itself has common path length one (2 such tuples), as does each leaf with its sibling (4 such tuples) and each leaf with its parent (8 such tuples). All other 2-tuples have only the root as a common ancestor. Hence a(2) = 2*4 + 1*(2 + 4 + 8) + 0 = 22.
