%C A215036 Take the first n primes and combine them with coefficients +1 and -1; then a(n) is the smallest number (in absolute value) that can be obtained.
%C A215036 For example, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 1 from 3-2 = 1; a(3) = 0 from -2-3+5 = 0; a(11) = 0 from 2-3-5-7+11-13+17+19-23-29+31 = 0.
%C A215036 Sketch of proof that the above sum of primes results in this sequence. If S_n is the set of possible values of the signed sums for the first n primes, then S_{n+1} = S_n U (S_n + prime(n+1)) U (S_n - prime(n+1)). Beyond about n=4, this will be everything even or everything odd in an interval around zero, and then a fringe on either side; the size of the interval will be 2 * A007504(n) - k for some small k. Recursively, since prime(n) << A007504(n), this will continue to hold. Hence the sequence continues to alternate 0's and 1's. A quite modest estimate on the distribution of primes suffices to complete the proof. - _Franklin T. Adams-Watters_, Aug 05 2012
