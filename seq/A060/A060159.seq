%N A060159 a(n) = initial term of the smallest tuple of exactly n consecutive Harshad numbers.
%C A060159 A number is called Harshad or Niven number iff it is divisible by the sum of its digits.
%C A060159 Cooper and Kennedy (1993) proved that this sequence contains 20 terms. - _Sergio Pimentel_, Sep 18 2008
%C A060159 a(16) = 50757686696033684694106416498959861492*10^280 - 9 and a(17) = 14107593985876801556467795907102490773681*10^280 - 10. - _Max Alekseyev_, Apr 07 2013
%C A060159 H. G. Grundman (1994) extended the Cooper and Kennedy result to show that there are 2b but not 2b + 1 consecutive Harshad numbers in any base b. - _Jianing Song_, Dec 16 2024

%e A060159 a(3) = 110 since (110, 111, 112) is the earliest run of 3 consecutive Harshad numbers: 110 is divisible by 1+1+0=2, 111 is divisible by 1+1+1=3, 112 is divisible by 1+1+2=4, but 109 is not divisible by 1+0+9=10, 113 is not divisible by 1+1+3=5, and there are no earlier runs of 3 consecutive numbers with this property.
