%N A182840 Toothpick sequence on hexagonal net.
%C A182840 Rules:
%C A182840 - Each new toothpick must lie on the hexagonal net such that the toothpick endpoints coincide with two consecutive nodes.
%C A182840 - Each exposed endpoint of the toothpicks of the old generation must be touched by the endpoints of two toothpicks of new generation.
%C A182840 The sequence gives the number of toothpicks after n stages. A182841 (the first differences) gives the number added at the n-th stage.
%C A182840 The toothpick structure has polygons in which there are uncovered grid points, the same as A160120 and A161206. For more information see A139250.
%C A182840 Has a behavior similar to A151723, A182632. - _Omar E. Pol_, Feb 28 2013
%C A182840 From _Omar E. Pol_, Feb 17 2023: (Start)
%C A182840 Assume that every triangular cell has area 1.
%C A182840 It appears that the structure contains only three types of polygons:
%C A182840 - Regular hexagons of area 6.
%C A182840 - Concave decagons (or concave 10-gons) of area 12.
%C A182840 - Concave dodecagons (or concave 12-gons) of area 18.
%C A182840 There are infinitely many of these polygons.
%C A182840 The structure contains concentric hexagonal rings formed by hexagons and also contains concentric hexagonal rings formed by alternating decagons and dodecagons.
%C A182840 For an animation see the movie version in the Links section.
%C A182840 The animation shows the fractal-like behavior the same as in other members of the family of toothpick cellular automata.
%C A182840 The structure has internal growth.
%C A182840 For another version starting from a node see A182632.
%C A182840 For a version of the structure in the first quadrant but on the square grid see A182838. (End)

%e A182840 We start at stage 0 with no toothpicks.
%e A182840 At stage 1 we place a toothpick anywhere in the plane (For example, in vertical position). There are two exposed endpoints, so a(1)=1.
%e A182840 At stage 2 we place 4 toothpicks. Two new toothpicks touching each exposed endpoint. So a(2)=1+4=5. There are 4 exposed endpoints.
%e A182840 At stage 3 we place 8 toothpicks. a(3)=5+8=13. The structure has 8 exposed endpoints.
%e A182840 At stage 4 we place 14 toothpicks (Not 16) because there are 4 endpoints that are touched by new 8 toothpicks but there are 4 endpoints that are touched by only 6 new toothpicks (not 8), so a(4)=13+14=27.
%e A182840 After 4 stages the toothpick structure has 4 hexagons and 8 exposed endpoints.
