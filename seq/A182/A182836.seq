%N A182836 Toothpick sequence starting at the vertex of the outside corner of an infinite 120-degree wedge on hexagonal net.
%C A182836 Corner sequence for the toothpick structure on hexagonal net.
%C A182836 The sequence gives the number of toothpicks after n stages. A182837 (the first differences) gives the number added at the n-th stage. For more information see A182632 and A153006.

%e A182836 We start at stage 0 with no toothpicks.
%e A182836 At stage 1 we place a single toothpick touching a vertex of the infinite hexagon, in direction to the center of the hexagon, but on the outside corner, so a(1)=1.
%e A182836 At stage 2 we place 2 toothpicks touching the exposed endpoint of the initial toothpick, so a(2)=1+2=3.
%e A182836 At stage 3 we place 4 toothpicks, so a(3)=3+4=7.
%e A182836 At stage 4 we place 8 toothpicks, so a(4)=7+8=15.
%e A182836 At stage 5 we place 12 toothpicks, so a(5)=15+12=27.
%e A182836 After 5 stages the toothpick structure has 5 hexagons and 6 exposed endpoints.
