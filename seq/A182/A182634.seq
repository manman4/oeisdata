%N A182634 Toothpick sequence on hexagonal net starting at the vertex of an infinite 120-degree wedge.
%C A182634 The sequence gives the number of toothpicks after n stages. A182635 (the first differences) gives the number added at the n-th stage.
%C A182634 The 120-degree wedge defines a conic region which toothpicks (except one end point of the initial toothpick) are not allowed to cross or touch. The wings of the wedge point +-60 degrees away from the pointing direction of the initial toothpick.
%C A182634 Toothpicks are connected by their endpoints, the same as the toothpicks of A182632.
%C A182634 First differs from A139250 at a(11).
