%N A182617 Number of toothpicks in a toothpick spiral around n cells on hexagonal net.
%C A182617 The toothpick spiral contains n hexagonal "ON" cells that are connected without holes. A hexagonal cell is "ON" if the hexagon has 6 vertices that are covered by the toothpicks.
%C A182617 Attempt of an explanation: in the hexagonal grid, we can pick any of the hexagons as a center, and then define a ring of 6 first neighbors (hexagons adjacent to the center), then define a ring of 12 second neighbors (hexagons adjacent to any of the first ring) and so on. The current sequence describes a self-avoiding walk which starts in a spiral around the center hexagon, which covers 5 edges. The walk then takes one step to reach the rim of the first ring and travels once around this ring until it reaches a point where self-avoidance stops it. It then takes one step to reach the rim of the second ring and walks around that one, etc. Imagine that on each edge we place a toothpick if it's on the path, and interrupt counting the total number of toothpicks each time one of the hexagons has six vertices covered. The total number of toothpicks after n-th stage define this sequence. Note that, except from the last sentence, this comment is a copy from _R. J. Mathar_'s comment in A182618 (Dec 13 2010). - _Omar E. Pol_, Sep 15 2013

%F A182617 Conjecture: a(n) = 2*n + ceiling(sqrt(12*n - 3)), for n > 0. - _Vincenzo Librandi_, Sep 20 2017
%e A182617 On the infinite hexagonal grid we start at stage 0 with no toothpicks, so a(0) = 0.
%e A182617 At stage 1 we place 5 toothpicks on the edges of the first hexagonal cell, so a(1) = 5.
%e A182617 At stage 2, from the last exposed endpoint, we place 4 other toothpicks on the edges of the second hexagonal cell, so a(2) = 5 + 4 = 9 because there are 9 toothpicks in the structure.
%e A182617 At stage 3, from the last exposed endpoint, we place 3 other toothpicks on the edges of the third hexagonal cell, so a(3) = 9 + 3 = 12 because there are 12 toothpicks in the spiral.
