%N A188620 Primes of the form x^3 + y^3 + 1.
%C A188620 x+y+1 also is a prime in most small cases.
%C A188620 As a(n) becomes large, it appears that x+y+1 is usually not prime; this is what one would expect. - _Franklin T. Adams-Watters_, Apr 05 2011
%e A188620 757 belongs to the sequence because 757 = 9^3+3^3+1 = 729+27+1.
