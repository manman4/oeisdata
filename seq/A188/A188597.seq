%N A188597 Odd deficient numbers whose abundancy is closer to 2 than any smaller odd deficient number.
%C A188597 The abundancy of a number k is defined as A(k) = sigma(k)/k. Deficient numbers have an abundancy less than 2. This sequence has terms in common with A171929. Sequence A188263, which deals with abundant numbers, approaches 2 from above. The similar sequence for even numbers consists of the powers of 2.
%C A188597 a(29) > 10^12. - _Donovan Johnson_, Apr 08 2011
%C A188597 This sequence is finite iff there is an odd perfect number (which would have abundancy 2). Otherwise, one always has a subsequent term a(n+1) <= a(n)*p where p is the smallest prime not dividing a(n) and larger than 1/(2/A(a(n))-1). Indeed, such an a(n)*p is still deficient but has abundancy larger than a(n), thus closer to 2. - _M. F. Hasler_, Feb 22 2017
%C A188597 From _M. F. Hasler_, Jan 25 2020: (Start)
%C A188597 The upper bounds a(n)*p mentioned above are often terms of the sequence, but not the subsequent but a later one: e.g., 9*5 = 45, 15*7 = 105, 45*7 = 315, 105*11 = 1155, 315*107 = 33705, 1155*389 = 449295, 26325*389 = 10240425, ...
%C A188597 Is 9 the largest term not divisible by 15? Only 7 of the 26 terms listed after 45 are not multiples of 7: is this subsequence finite? (End)
%C A188597 a(38) = 1412875743840099 is the next term after 9 not divisible by 15. The number of terms not divisible by 7 is conjectured to be infinite provided no odd perfect numbers exist. - _Alexander Violette_, Sep 26 2025
