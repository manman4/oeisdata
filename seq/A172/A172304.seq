%N A172304 L-toothpick sequence starting with two opposite L-toothpicks.
%C A172304 The same as A172310 but starting with two L-toothpicks.
%C A172304 We start at stage 0 with no L-toothpicks.
%C A172304 At stage 1 we place two large L-toothpicks in the horizontal direction, as a "X", anywhere in the plane.
%C A172304 At stage 2 we place four small L-toothpicks.
%C A172304 At stage 3 we add eight more large L-toothpicks.
%C A172304 At stage 4 we add eight more small L-toothpicks.
%C A172304 And so on ...
%C A172304 The L-toothpick cellular automaton has an unusual property: the growths in its four wide wedges [North, East, South and West] have a recurrent behavior related to powers of 2, as we can find in other cellular automata (i.e., A212008). On the other hand, in its four narrow wedges [NE, SE, SW, NW] the behavior seems to be chaotic, without any recurrence, similar to the behavior of the snowflake cellular automaton of A161330. The remarkable fact is that with the same rules, different behaviors are produced. (See Applegate's movie version in the Links section.) - _Omar E. Pol_, Nov 06 2018
