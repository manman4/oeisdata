%N A172308 L-toothpick sequence in the first quadrant.
%C A172308 The same as A172310 and A172304, but starting from half L-toothpick in the first quadrant.
%C A172308 Note that if n is odd then we add the small L-toothpicks to the structure, otherwise we add the large L-toothpicks to the structure.
%C A172308 We start at stage 0 with half L-toothpick: A segment from (0,0) to (1,1).
%C A172308 At stage 1 we place a small L-toothpick at the exposed toothpick end.
%C A172308 At stage 2 we place two large L-toothpicks.
%C A172308 At stage 3 we place two small L-toothpicks.
%C A172308 At stage 4 we place two large L-toothpicks.
%C A172308 And so on...
%C A172308 The sequence gives the number of L-toothpicks after n stages. A172309 (the first differences) gives the number of L-toothpicks added at the n-th stage.
