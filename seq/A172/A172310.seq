%N A172310 L-toothpick sequence (see Comment lines for definition).
%C A172310 We define an "L-toothpick" to consist of two line segments forming an "L".
%C A172310 There are two size for L-toothpicks: Small and large. Each component of small L-toothpick has length 1. Each component of large L- toothpick has length sqrt(2).
%C A172310 The rule for the n-th stage:
%C A172310 If n is odd then we add the large L-toothpicks to the structure, otherwise we add the small L-toothpicks to the structure.
%C A172310 Note that, on the infinite square grid, every large L-toothpick is placed with angle = 45 degrees and every small L-toothpick is placed with angle = 90 degrees.
%C A172310 The special rule: L-toothpicks are not added if this would lead to overlap with another L-toothpick branch in the same generation.
%C A172310 We start at stage 0 with no L-toothpicks.
%C A172310 At stage 1 we place a large L-toothpick in the horizontal direction, as a "V", anywhere in the plane (Note that there are two exposed endpoints).
%C A172310 At stage 2 we place two small L-toothpicks.
%C A172310 At stage 3 we place four large L-toothpicks.
%C A172310 At stage 4 we place six small L-toothpicks.
%C A172310 And so on...
%C A172310 The sequence gives the number of L-toothpick after n stages. A172311 (the first differences) gives the number of L-toothpicks added at the n-th stage.
%C A172310 For more information see A139250, the toothpick sequence.
%C A172310 In calculating the extension, the "special rule" was strengthened to prohibit intersections as well as overlappings. [From _John W. Layman_, Feb 04 2010]
%C A172310 Note that the endpoints of the L-toothpicks of the new generation can touch the L-toothp√¨cks of old generations but the crosses and overlaps are prohibited. - _Omar E. Pol_, Mar 26 2016
%C A172310 The L-toothpick cellular automaton has an unusual property: the growths in its four wide wedges [North, East, South and West] have a recurrent behavior related to powers of 2, as we can find in other cellular automata (i.e., A194270). On the other hand, in its four narrow wedges [NE, SE, SW, NW] the behavior seems to be chaotic, without any recurrence, similar to the behavior of the snowflake cellular automaton of A161330. The remarkable fact is that with the same rules, different behaviors are produced. (See Applegate's movie version in the Links section.) - _Omar E. Pol_, Nov 06 2018
