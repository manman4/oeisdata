%N A236677 a(0)=1; for n>0, a(n) = (1-a(floor(log_2(n)))) * a(n-msb(n)); characteristic function of A079599.
%C A236677 This is NOT the leftmost column of A125999, as here a(2^64) = 0, while X_A126002(2^64) = 1.

%F A236677 a(0) = 1 and for n > 0, a(n) = (1-a(A000523(n))) * a(A053645(n)) [where A000523 gives the bit-index of the most significant bit of n (msb), and A053645 gives n without its msb].
%F A236677 For all n, a(n) * A034798(n) = 0 (as ones in this sequence occur at the positions where zeros are in A034798).

%Y A236677 A236678 gives the partial sums. Differs from the characteristic function of A047467 for the first at n=256, as here a(256)=0, while X_A047467(256)=1 because 256 = 0 modulo 8.
%Y A236677 Cf. A079599, A034798.
