%N A186963 Number of prime factors in the expansion of the infinitary perfect number A007357(n) over distinct terms of A050376.
%C A186963 The total number of factors in the decomposition of A007357(n) in terms of A050376 is A187043(n). The subset of factors which are ordinary primes are counted here.
%F A186963 a(n) = A162642(A007357(n)). - _R. J. Mathar_, Mar 30 2011
%e A186963 The unique expansion of A007357(2) = 60 as a product of terms of A050376 is 3*4*5. Two of these factors, namely 3 and 5, are primes (A000040), so a(2) = 2.
