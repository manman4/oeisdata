%N A387324 Smallest unhappy number that takes n iterations of the sum of the squares of digits to reach 4, ignoring the 4 cycle itself.
%C A387324 Identical to A092952 for 2<=n<=5, n=7, 11<=n<=14; distinct otherwise.
%C A387324 In general, for n >= 16, a(n+1) will be approximately ceiling(a(n)/81) digits in length, as the dominating factor is the number of 9s required, each contributing 81 to the total sum. a(18) is 199 digits in length, a(19) is approximately 10^200 digits in length, and so on.
%C A387324 "Ignoring the 4-cycle itself" in the requirement means that members of the 8-cycle themselves are banned from this sequence. E.g. a(6) is not 58 (smaller than 77) because 58 is a member of the 8-cycle. - _R. J. Mathar_, Sep 26 2025

%e A387324 a(6) = 77 because it takes 6 iterations to reach 4: 77, 7^2 + 7^2 = 98, 9^2 + 8^2 = 145, 1^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 = 42, 4^2 + 2^2 = 20, 2^2 + 0^2 = 4.
