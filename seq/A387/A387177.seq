%N A387177 Numbers whose prime indices have choosable sets of strict integer partitions. Positions of nonzero terms in A387115.
%C A387177 A prime index of n is a number m such that prime(m) divides n. The multiset of prime indices of n is row n of A112798.
%C A387177 We say that a sequence of nonempty sets is choosable iff it is possible to choose a different element from each set. For example, ({1,2},{1},{1,3}) is choosable because we have the choice (2,1,3), but ({1},{2},{1,3},{2,3}) is not.
%e A387177 The prime indices of 50 are {1,3,3}, and {(1),(3),(2,1)} is a valid choice of distinct strict partitions, so 50 is in the sequence.
