%N A387325 Self-inverse permutation of the nonnegative integers, by swapping and converting the head and tail parts of n in binary and using the rightmost 0-bit as their separator.
%C A387325 The tail value is the number of trailing 1-bits, so is zero for even n. The head value is in base-2 and is formed by the leading bits up to the lowest 0-bit, right before the tail, so is zero when there is no such 0-bit.

%F A387325 a(2^k-1) = 2*k and a(2^k*(2*i+3)-1) = 2 * a(2^k*(2*i+1)-1) + 1, for i, k >= 0; which together are sufficient to generate the sequence.
%F A387325 Fixed points are at n = i*2^i*2 + 2^i-1, for i >= 0.
%e A387325 a(27) = 39, because for 27 = 11.0.11_2 the head value is 11_2 = 3 and the tail value is 2 (trailing 1-bits), and for 39 = 10.0.111_2 the tail value is 3 (trailing 1-bits) and the head value is 10_2 = 2.
%e A387325 a(43) = 159, because for 43 = 101.0.11_2 the head value is 101_2 = 5 and the tail value is 2 (trailing 1-bits), and for 159 = 10.0.11111_2 the tail value is 5 (trailing 1-bits) and  the head value is 10_2 = 2.
