%N A387381 Least prime p such that p+x_1, ..., p+x_1+...+x_k are prime, where (x_1, ..., x_k) is the n-th composition in graded reverse lexicographic order ("standard order", see A066099); or 0 if no such prime exists.

%e A387381 For n = 0, the 0th composition is the empty composition, so a(0) = 2 is the smallest prime.
%e A387381 For n = 3, the 3rd composition is (1,1). There is no prime p such that p+1 and p+1+1 = p+2 are prime, so a(3) = 0.
%e A387381 For n = 34, the 34th composition is (4,2) and the least prime p such that p+4 and p+4+2 = p+6 are prime is a(34) = 7.
%e A387381 For n = 40, the 40th composition is (2,4) and the least prime p such that p+2 and p+2+4 = p+6 are prime is a(40) = 5.
