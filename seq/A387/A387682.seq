%N A387682 a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2, a(3) = 4; for n > 3, a(n) is the smallest unused positive number that shares a factor with a(n-1) and a(n-2) if a(n-1) > a(n-2), else it is coprime to a(n-1) and a(n-2) if a(n-1) < a(n-2).
%C A387682 The overall size of the graph of the terms is dominated by terms which are the product of two preceding prime terms, the first example being a(15) = 77; there are 35 such products in the first 10000 terms. For terms less than 3*n the graph shows the terms are concentrated along various lines, with the upper terms all being semiprimes - see the attached colored image.
%C A387682 For the terms studied the primes, other than 3 and 5, appear in their natural order, and the only two fixed points are the first two terms. The sequence is conjectured to be a permutation of the positive numbers.
