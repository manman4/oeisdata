%N A387174 a(n) is a prime that is the average of two distinct primes p and q, neither of which has been used before as such. However, the average can be any prime, including previous p's or q's.
%C A387174 The distinction between a prime that is a term and the primes p and q is by definition only, and values in both sets may intersect and can be used for either role. Any p and q determined by the rule, cannot however be used more than once for that purpose.
%C A387174 In the situation where a term has more than one possible representation, all possible p and q are eliminated from further consideration. See a(8) in the Examples.
%C A387174 Will there be ever increasing runs of missing primes from this sequence?
%C A387174 Will there be ever increasing numbers of multiple (p, q) value pairs corresponding to some terms?

%e A387174 Trying to find the first suitable term, neither the double of 2 nor that of 3, that is, 4 and 6, can be partitioned into two distinct primes p and q, so 2 and 3 cannot be the defined averages of any p and q for the sequence.
%e A387174 So moving onto 5 as a candidate for the first term, we successfully find a(1) with it.
%e A387174 a(1) = 5 as (3 + 7)/2 = 5 with p = 3 and q = 7, these primes satisfy the condition. No other distinct p and q add up to 10 so as 5 to become also their average.
%e A387174 In the next step, a new term and the double of its value is sought after, and 2*7 = 14 is tried. It can be partitioned into 3 and 11, both primes, but 3 was already used for a(1) in the role of p. 5 + 9 is not good as 9 is not a prime. Therefore we reject 7 as a candidate term, and move on.
%e A387174 a(2) = 11 is successfully found, whose double is 22. As 22 = 5 + 17, both unused primes for the role of p and q, whose average is 11, and so this new term is valid. Note that 5 was already used as a term, but not as p or q before. Here, a(2) does not yield further p and q by the rule, either.
%e A387174 With subsequent primes tried we find at times no result, at other times further terms are produced to fill in the sequence.
%e A387174 a(8) = 67 is the first term that produces two distinct p's and q's, which it is a common average of: (37 + 97)/2 = (31 + 103)/2 = 67. After this step, none of 31, 37, 97, or 103 can be used for p or q in future terms.
