%N A387028 a(n) is the minimum value where A262690(k) >= n^2 for all k >= a(n).
%C A387028 Sequence is interesting primarily because of A062535. If all members of A062535 were 0, then this sequence would be the same as the squares. But A062535 has some nonzero terms, so this sequence gets the upper limits.
%F A387028 a(n) <= 4*n^2.
%e A387028 a(3) = 13 because 12 is the largest value of n where A262690(n) < 9.
%Y A387028 Cf. A062535, A262690.
