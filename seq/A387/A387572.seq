%N A387572 a(n) is the length of the disturbed prefix after n steps of the iterative process defined in the Comments.
%C A387572 We first define an iteration process, starting with the infinite sequence of natural numbers (1,2,3,4,5...)  In each iteration, the following steps are applied to generate a permuted sequence of the natural numbers:
%C A387572 i. Let p be the current leftmost term of the sequence.
%C A387572 ii. Extract the first p elements into a block G.
%C A387572 iii. Remove G from the beginning of the sequence and reinsert it after skipping the next p terms in the sequence.
%C A387572 Let a(n) of the series be defined, after exactly n iterations of the above process, as the smallest index m of the permuted sequence such that from position m+1 in the sequence, the sequence coincides with the natural numbers.
%C A387572 Put in a different way, a(n) is the length of the disturbed/jumbled prefix after n iterations. For a(0) the value is 0 because no iterations have been performed and so, no changes have been made to the sequence of natural numbers.
%C A387572 a(n) is always even.

%e A387572 At n=2, the permutation starts with p=3 so that the first 3 terms 3,4,2 move 3 further places ahead, marked "^", to form the next permutation.
%e A387572 Iteration 1: the leftmost term is (1). Thus, the group G would include a block of just one term from the left, e.g. the term [1]. That group will be moved 1 steps to the right to result in: 2, 1, 3, 4, 5... => A(1)=2 (from 3 onward the sequence is as in the original);
%e A387572 Iteration 2: the leftmost term is (2). Thus, the group G would include a block of two term from the left - [2, 1]. That group will be moved 2 steps to the right to result in: 3, 4, 2, 1, 5, 6...=> A(2)=4 (from 5 onward the sequence is as in the original);
%e A387572 Iteration 3: the leftmost term is (3). Thus, the group G would include a block of three term from the left - [3, 4, 2]. That group will be moved 3 steps to the right to result in: 1, 5, 6, 3, 4, 2, 7, 8...=> A(3)=6 (from 7 onward the sequence is as in the original);
