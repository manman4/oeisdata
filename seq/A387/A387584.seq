%N A387584 Size of largest subset of {1, ..., n} such that any 4 elements (a <= b <= c <= d) whose product is square implies a*d = b*c.
%C A387584 a(p) = a(p-1) + 1 for primes p, as the prime cannot increase the number of sets of elements whose products are square, and so can be added to the prior largest subset.
%C A387584 a(n) - a(n-1) >= 0, as any subset that satisfies the condition for n-1 is also a subset of {1, ..., n} that satisfies the condition.
%C A387584 a(n) - a(n-1) <= 1, as if it were larger, then it means we added two elements, one of which isn't n to a subset that satisfied the condition for {1, ..., n-1}, so adding the one that isn't n should have been a solution for a(n-1).
%C A387584 Sequence relates to Erdős problem 888.
%C A387584 The set of all primes and products of two different primes (A167171) up to n satisfies the condition. It is a largest set with this property from n=15 up to at least 203. - _Christian Sievers_, Sep 20 2025

%e A387584 For n=4, any subset with 3 elements will trivially satisfy the condition. But because a=b=c=1 and d=4 does not satisfy the condition, we must have a(4) = 3.
%e A387584 For n=5, we can take any subset with 3 elements that satisfied the condition for n=4, and add the element 5.
%e A387584 Terms a(1)-a(20) are witnessed by subsets of {1,2,3,5,6,7,10,11,13,14,17,19} (and possibly other subsets of equal sizes), while terms a(21)-a(40) are witnessed by subsets of {2,3,5,6,7,10,11,13,14,15,17,19,21,22,23,26,29,31,33,34,35,37,38,39}. - _Charlie Neder_, Sep 11 2025
