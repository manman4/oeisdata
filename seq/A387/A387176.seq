%N A387176 Numbers whose prime indices do not have choosable sets of strict integer partitions. Zeros of A387115.
%C A387176 A prime index of n is a number m such that prime(m) divides n. The multiset of prime indices of n is row n of A112798.
%C A387176 We say that a sequence of nonempty sets is choosable iff it is possible to choose a different element from each set. For example, ({1,2},{1},{1,3}) is choosable because we have the choice (2,1,3), but ({1},{2},{1,3},{2,3}) is not.
