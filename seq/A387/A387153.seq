%N A387153 Squarefree 3-abundant numbers: squarefree numbers k such that A000203(k) > 3*k.
%C A387153 First differs from A067885 at n = 11: A067885(11) = 72930 is not a term of this sequence. a(59) = 510510 is the least term of this sequence that is not in A067885.
%C A387153 Subsequence of A285615 and first differs from it at n = 51: A285615(51) = 390390 is not a term of this sequence.
%C A387153 This sequence is not the same as the sequence of numbers k such that A048250(k) > 3*k which includes all the terms of this sequence but also nonsquarefree numbers, the least of them is 2*A002110(52) = A088860(52) = 2.1248...*10^96.
%C A387153 The least odd term is A002110(17)/2 = 961380175077106319535, the least term that is not divisible by 3 is a(5607800) = 66853496710, and the least term that is coprime to 6 is A002110(52)/6 = 1.7706...*10^95.
%C A387153 If k is a term and m is a squarefree number coprime to k, then k*m is also a term.
%C A387153 The numbers of terms not exceeding 10^k, for k = 5, 6, ..., are 17, 95, 795, 8162, 86331, 854164, 8372782, ... . Apparently, the asymptotic density of this sequence exists and equals 0.00008... .
