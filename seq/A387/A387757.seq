%N A387757 a(1) = 1, a(2) = 3; for n > 2, a(n) is the smallest unused positive number that differs from a(n-1) by more than 1 and shares a factor with a(n-1) if a(n-1) < a(n-2), else it is coprime to a(n-1) if a(n-1) > a(n-2).
%C A387757 The sequence is composed of two main lines of terms, the upper, sparsely populated line, being even semiprimes, while the lower contains all other terms. The primes do not appear in their natural order, although those out of order are not common.
%C A387757 There are 73 fixed points in the first 500000 terms, these are 1, 16, 22, 28, 34, ..., 1901, 3174, 33376. It is likely no more exist. The sequence is conjectured to be a permutation of the positive integers.

%e A387757 a(3) = 5 as a(2) = 3 > a(1) = 1, and 5 is the smallest unused number that differs from 3 by more than 1 and is coprime to 3.
%e A387757 a(5) = 4 as a(4) = 2 < a(3) = 5, and 4 is the smallest unused number that differs from 2 by more than 1 and shares a factor with 2.
