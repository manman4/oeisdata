%N A387112 Numbers with (strictly) choosable initial intervals of prime indices.
%C A387112 First differs from A371088 in having a(86) = 121.
%C A387112 The initial interval of a nonnegative integer x is the set {1,...,x}.
%C A387112 A prime index of n is a number m such that prime(m) divides n. The multiset of prime indices of n is row n of A112798.
%C A387112 We say that a set or sequence of nonempty sets is choosable iff it is possible to choose a different element from each set. For example, ({1,2},{1},{1,3}) is choosable because we have the choice (2,1,3), but ({1,2,3},{1},{1,3},{2}) is not.
%C A387112 This sequence lists all numbers k such that if the prime indices of k are (x1,x2,...,xz), then the sequence of sets (initial intervals) ({1,...,x1},{1,...,x2},...,{1,...,xz}) is choosable.
%C A387112 Conjecture: Also numbers whose weakly increasing prime indices y satisfy y(i) >= i for every index i.
%e A387112 The prime indices of 85 are {3,7}, with initial intervals {{1,2,3},{1,2,3,4,5,6,7}}, which are choosable, so 85 is in the sequence
%e A387112 The prime indices of 90 are {1,2,2,3}, with initial intervals {{1},{1,2},{1,2},{1,2,3}}, which are not choosable, so 90 is not in the sequence.
