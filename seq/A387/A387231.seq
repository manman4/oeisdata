%N A387231 a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2; for n > 2, a(n) is the smallest unused positive number that shares a factor with a(n-1) if a(n-1) > a(n-2), else it is coprime to a(n-1) if a(n-1) < a(n-2).
%C A387231 The sequence is composed of two main lines of terms, the upper being even semiprimes, while the lower contains all other terms. For the terms studied the primes appear in their natural order.
%C A387231 In the first 100000 terms the fixed points are 1, 2, 8, 15, 32, 44, 50, 60, 90, 182, 198, 220; it is likely no more exist. The sequence is conjectured to be a permutation of the positive integers.

%e A387231 a(4) = 6 as a(3) = 4 > a(2) = 3, and 6 is the smallest unused number that shares a factor with 4.
%e A387231 a(6) = 5 as a(5) = 3 < a(4) = 6, and 5 is the smallest unused number that is coprime to 3.
