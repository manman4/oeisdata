%N A387215 a(n) is the smallest k such that, for any m >= k, m is a sum of exactly n distinct primes.
%C A387215 In computation it is assumed that if for any m where a(n) = k <= m <= k + 3*n we have m is the sum of n distinct positive integers then a(n) = k.
%e A387215 a(3) = 18 as 17 is not the sum of 3 distinct primes but any integer m where 18 <= m <= 27 is the sum of 3 distinct primes. It is therefore assumed that a(3) = 18.
