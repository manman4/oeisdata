%N A387902 Index of A002313(n) in A005529.
%C A387902 Both A002313 and A005529 are lists of the primes which have -1 as a quadratic residue, but are ordered differently. The sequence {a(n)} is a permutation of the positive integers. It would be of interest if permutations obtained from other quadratic residues, such as 2 mod(p), although involving different primes, were abstractly related to this permutation.
%e A387902 a(122)=372 because the 122nd prime listed in A002313 is 1609, and the index of 1609 in A005529 is 372.
