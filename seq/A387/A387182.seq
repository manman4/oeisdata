%N A387182 Positive integers k where, for zeta_k a primitive k-th root of unity, the set S_k = {(1-zeta_k^i)/(1-zeta_k) : 1<i<k/2, GCD(i,k)=1} has a nontrivial (multiplicative) dependence relation.
%C A387182 By Theorem 3(2) in Feng's paper, the existence of a dependence relation in S can be shown for k!=2 mod 4 as follows. For k with prime factorization k=p_1^e_1*...*p_l^e_l, let k_i=k/(p_i^e_i) for i=1,...,l. If there is some i for which, in the group of units mod k_i, the subgroup generated by -1 and p_i does not generate the entire unit group mod k_i, then k is in this sequence.
%C A387182 It follows that no primes or prime powers are in this sequence.
%C A387182 If k=2 mod 4, let k'=k/2. The k'-th and k-th cyclotomic fields are equal. There is a dependence relation in S_k if and only if there is a dependence relation in S_k'. As a result, if k=2 mod 4, then k is in this sequence if and only if k/2 is in this sequence.
%C A387182 It is known that if k is in this sequence, then all multiples of k are in this sequence as well.
%C A387182 It is known that if k!=2 mod 4 and k has at least 4 prime divisors, then k is in this sequence.

%e A387182 Let k=39. Then k=3^1*13^1. Then k_1=39/3=13 and k_2=39/13=3. For U_13 the group of units mod 13, the subgroup of U_13 generated by -1 and 3 is <-1,3>={1,3,4,9,10,12}. Since <-1,3>!=U_13, k=39 is in this sequence.
%e A387182 For k=39, a dependence relation among elements of S_k is Product_{g in {4,10,14,16,17}} c_g^78 * Product_{h in {2,5,7,8,11,19}} c_h^(-78) = 1, where c_j=(1-zeta_39^j)/(1-zeta_39). (See Section 3.3 of Shor and Sim's paper for details.)
%e A387182 For a non-example, let k=21. Working in U_7, <-1,3>=U_7. And working in U_3, <-1,7>=U_3. Hence k=21 is not in this sequence.
