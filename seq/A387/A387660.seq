%e A387660 a(4) = 10 because subtracting 4 from the previous term (6) would give 2, which is smaller than 4, so add 4 to 6 to get 10.
%e A387660 a(6) = 9 because subtracting 6 from the previous term (15) gives 9, which is bigger than 6, and has not appeared before.
%e A387660 a(9) = 33 because subtracting 9 from the previous term (24) gives 15, which is bigger than 9, but has appeared before, so add 9 to 24 to get 33.
