%N A387838 Lexicographically earliest infinite sequence of distinct positive numbers such that, for n > 3, a(n) is the largest number less than a(n-2) that shares a factor with a(n-1) and is coprime to a(n-2), or if no such number exists then a(n) is the smallest number greater than a(n-2) that shares a factor with a(n-1) and is coprime to a(n-2).
%C A387838 Similar to A336957, to ensure the sequence is infinite a(n) must be chosen such that it has a prime factor that is not a factor of a(n-1), therefore, other than 2, no primes can appear.
%C A387838 Overall the terms of the sequence have periods where two neighboring terms mutually decrease as each successive term in the pair is slightly less than its previous value. This continues until a term cannot be found that is less than a(n-2); this causes a large increase in the next value, leading the sequence overall to grow in size rapidly.
%C A387838 Of the terms studied the only fixed points are 1 and 2; it is likely no more exist.

%e A387838 a(6) = 14 as 13 shares a factor with a(5) = 35, is coprime to a(4) = 15, and has a prime factor, namely 2, that is not a factor of a(5) = 35.
