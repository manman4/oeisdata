%N A387223 Number of noncongruent primitive points in a face-centered cubic lattice that intersect a sphere of radius 2*n-1 centered on a point in the lattice.
%C A387223 Here a primitive point is one which is not an integer multiple of a point that intersects a sphere of a smaller integer radius, e.g. [13.5, 1.5, 9*sqrt(1/2)] is not primitive for sphere radius 15 (n = 8) because it is a multiple of [4.5, 0.5, 3*sqrt(1/2)] which is primitive for sphere radius 5 (n = 3).
%C A387223 Subset of A387222, excluding nonprimitive points, and omitting spheres with even radii (radius 0 has only the 1 center point, and all others have no primitive points).
%C A387223 It is observed that for most n >= 6, at least 1 combination of at least 3 of the a(n) constituent points, as n*2-1 length vectors, can be arranged via cuboctahedral rotations and reflections to form a closed walk. E.g. for n = 6, the 3 noncongruent vectors of length 6*2-1 = 11 can be arranged as [5/2, 19/2, 7*sqrt(1/2)] + [8, -7, -4*sqrt(1/2)] + [-21/2, -5/2, -3*sqrt(1/2)] = [0, 0, 0].
%e A387223 a(5) = 2 (radius = 5*2-1 = 9): [15/2, 1/2, 7*sqrt(1/2)] and [8, 3, 4*sqrt(1/2)], because this is the minimal set of points whose cuboctahedral rotations and reflections comprise all of the primitive points in a fcc lattice that intersect a sphere of radius 9 centered on a point in the lattice. Additional points [9, 0, 0] and [15/2, 9/2, 3*sqrt(1/2)] are not counted as they are nonprimitive, reducing to [1, 0, 0] and [5/2, 3/2, sqrt(1/2)] respectively.
