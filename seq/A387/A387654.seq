%N A387654 Numbers k such that each of k and k+1 is either a practical number (A005153) or an almost practical number (A174533).
%C A387654 Differs from A103289 by not having the terms 7424, 27404, 43064, 56924, 70784, ... . The first 344 terms of this sequence are in A103289. Is this sequence a subsequence of A103289?
%C A387654 Differs from A096399 by not having the terms 7424, 27404, 43064, 56924, 70784, ... . The first 342 terms after 1 and 4095 are in A096399. Is this sequence \ {1, 4095} a subsequence of A096399?
%C A387654 Terms k such that both k and k+1 are almost practical numbers are in A387653.
%C A387654 The only pair of consecutive integers that are both practical is 1 and 2, since 1 is the only odd practical number.
%C A387654 All the rest are pairs in which one member (the odd member) is almost practical and the second member (the even member) is practical.
%C A387654 Are there 3 consecutive numbers that are all either practical or almost practical? There are none below 2.8*10^6.
