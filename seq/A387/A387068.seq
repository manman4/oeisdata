%N A387068 Number of equivalence classes (up to homeomorphism) of finite, connected ribbon graphs that have an embedding in an orientable surface of genus n which minimally separates the surface of genus n (that is, no proper subset of the embedding separates the genus n surface) but not the surface of genus n-1.
%C A387068 n is called the least separating genus.
%C A387068 These numbers are larger than those of A387067, because different embeddings of the same graph are counted separately. For instance, there is a ribbon graph for the bouquet of 3 circles with least separating genus 1 and a different embedding with least separating genus 2.

%e A387068 For genus 0: thickened circle.
%e A387068 For genus 1: thickened versions of a bouquet of 2 circles, bouquet of 3 circles, 4-fold multi-edge.
