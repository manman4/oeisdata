%N A387302 Numbers k that can be written as k = s_1^x_1 + ... + s_t^x_t, with 1 < s_1 < ... < s_t and {s_1,..., s_t} = {x_1,..., x_t} for some t > 0 such that for all possible representations of k the permutations connecting (s_1,...,s_t) with (x_1,...,x_t) are cyclic.
%C A387302 Every number in A385969 can be written as a (possibly trivial) sum of numbers in this sequence.
%e A387302 See examples in A385969 (note that 31 is excluded as 31 = 2^2 + 3^3).
%e A387302 32 = 2^4 + 4^2.
%e A387302 57 = 2^5 + 5^2.
%e A387302 89 = 2^4 + 3^2 + 4^3.
%e A387302 545 does not appear: the permutations associated with both representations 2^6 + 3^2 + 4^4 + 6^3 and 2^7 + 3^5 + 5^3 + 7^2 are not cyclic.
%e A387302 2409 does not appear: the permutation related to 2^6 + 4^5 + 5^2 + 6^4 is cyclic but the one related to 2^8 + 3^6 + 4^3 + 6^4 + 8^2 is not.
%e A387302 4684 appears: the permutations associated with both representations 2^7 + 3^4 + 4^6 + 6^2 + 7^3 and 2^8 + 3^5 + 4^3 + 5^2 + 8^4 are cyclic.
