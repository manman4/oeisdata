%N A387758 Lexicographically earliest infinite sequence of distinct positive numbers such that, for n > 2, a(n) shares a factor with a(n-1) and is coprime to a(n-2) if a(n-1) > a(n-2), else it is coprime to a(n-1) and shares a factor with a(n-2) if a(n-1) < a(n-2).
%C A387758 The sequence uses the selection rules for a(n) of either A336957 or A098550 if a(n-1) is greater than or less than a(n-2) respectively. For the four combinations of the relative sizes of a(n-2), a(n-1) and a(n), only for the case a(n-2) < a(n-1) < a(n) do we need to ensure that a(n) contains a prime factor that is not in a(n-1), as in A336957. The other cases need not be checked as the rules ensure the next term will always exist, e.g., for a(n-2) < a(n-1) > a(n), a(n-1) must contain a prime factor not in a(n), which ensures a(n+1) will exist, as if it didn't a(n) would have been chosen for a(n-1) instead.
%C A387758 For the terms studied the primes do not all occur in their natural order, although those primes out of order are relatively rare, the first being a(140) = 41. The primes all fall in the lower lines of terms that comprise the graph; see the attached colored image.
%C A387758 In the first 250000 terms the fixed points are 1, 2, 8, 15, 25, 42, 49, 81, 90, 564; it is not known if more exist. The sequence is conjectured to be a permutation of the positive integers.

%H A387758 Scott R. Shannon, <a href="/A387758/a387758.png">Image of the first 250000 terms</a>. The colors are graduated across the spectrum to show the total number of prime factors of each term, with red being one prime factor. The thin green line is a(n) = n.
%e A387758 a(6) = 10 as a(5) = 4 > a(4) = 3, and 10 is an unused number and shares a factor with 4 while being coprime to 3. Note that 8 also has these properties, but 8 contains no prime factor that is not in a(4) = 4, thus choosing 8, which is larger than a(4) = 4, would halt the sequence as a(7) would then not exist.
%e A387758 a(11) = 14 as a(10) = 9 < a(9) = 12, and 14 is the smallest unused number that shares a factor with 12 while being coprime to 9.
