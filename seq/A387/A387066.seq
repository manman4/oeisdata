%N A387066 Number of equivalence classes (up to graph homeomorphism) of finite graphs that have an embedding in an orientable surface of genus n which minimally separates the surface of genus n (that is, no proper subset of the embedding separates the genus n surface) but not the surface of genus n-1.
%C A387066 n is called the least separating genus.
