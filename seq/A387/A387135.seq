%N A387135 Number of distinct prime factors in common to all prime indices of n.
%C A387135 A prime index of n is a number m such that prime(m) divides n. The multiset of prime indices of n is row n of A112798.
%F A387135 a(n) = A001221(A289508(n)).
%F A387135 a(prime(n)) = A001221(n).
%e A387135 The prime indices of 2257 are {12,18}, with common prime factors {2,3}, so a(2257) = 2.
