%N A387630 A005117(k) - 1 such that A389412(k) is a record value.
%C A387630 Numbers A005117(k) - 1 such that the length m of the series {A005117(k) - 1 + A005117(i)}, 1 <= i <= m, is a record.
%C A387630 The corresponding A389412(k) for a(1) to a(10) are: 2, 3, 4, 11, 38, 46, 54, 60, 105, 127.
%C A387630 The series of non-unitary prime divisors for a(1) to (10) is nondecreasing (0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4). This is to be expected as, for some x, the more non-unitary prime divisors x has and the smaller the size of the dividing primes, the greater the probability of choosing a number s = x + A005117(i) and for s to be squarefree (see the Englezou link). For example, within the set {1455300 + A005117(i)} approximately 97% of numbers are squarefree.

%e A387630 The second term is 4 since 5 is the 4th squarefree number, and A389412(4) = 3, and 3 is greater than any term prior to A389412(4).
%e A387630 The third term is 12 since 13 is the 9th squarefree number, and A389412(9) = 4, and 4 is greater than any term prior to A389412(9).
%e A387630 The fourth term is 28 since 29 is the 18th squarefree number, and A389412(18) = 11, and 11 is greater than any term prior to A389412(18).
