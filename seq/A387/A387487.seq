%N A387487 Numbers in the ring of integers Z such that k * k = k, the idempotents of Z.
%C A387487 In Z the only idempotents are 0 and 1 since Z is an integral domain (no zero divisors).
%C A387487 Within Z, 0 is the additive identity, and 1 is the multiplicative identity. However {0, 1} is not a subring of Z since it is not closed under these operations.
%C A387487 These are the nonnegative numbers that are neither prime nor composite.
%C A387487 The set {0, 1} forms the ring of integers modulo 2, denoted as Z/2Z, which is a field with two elements, but then 0 and 1 are not integers but represent residue classes modulo 2.
%C A387487 {0, 1} is the carrier set for Boolean Algebra where the correspondence is often established via the Iverson bracket.
%C A387487 {0, 1} is used in the binary numeral system (base-2) to represent an integer (or real number) using only the digits 0 and 1.
%C A387487 {0, 1} is the von Neumann representation of the ordinal 2.
%H A387487 Wikipedia, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotent_(ring_theory)">Idempotent (ring theory)</a>.
%F A387487 {0, 1} are the roots of (x - 1)*x.
%F A387487 A001477 = {0, 1} U A000040 U A002808 where 'U' denotes the disjoint union.
