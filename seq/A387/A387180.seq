%N A387180 Numbers of which it is not possible to choose a different constant integer partition of each prime index.
%C A387180 First differs from A276079 in having 125.
%C A387180 A prime index of n is a number m such that prime(m) divides n. The multiset of prime indices of n is row n of A112798.
%C A387180 Also numbers n with at least one prime index k such that the multiplicity of prime(k) in the prime factorization of n exceeds the number of divisors of k.
%e A387180 The prime indices of 60 are {1,1,2,3}, and we have the following 4 choices of constant partitions:
%e A387180   ((1),(1),(2),(3))
%e A387180   ((1),(1),(2),(1,1,1))
%e A387180   ((1),(1),(1,1),(3))
%e A387180   ((1),(1),(1,1),(1,1,1))
%e A387180 Since none of these is strict, 60 is in the sequence.
%e A387180 The prime indices of 90 are {1,2,2,3}, and we have the following 4 strict choices:
%e A387180   ((1),(2),(1,1),(3))
%e A387180   ((1),(2),(1,1),(1,1,1))
%e A387180   ((1),(1,1),(2),(3))
%e A387180   ((1),(1,1),(2),(1,1,1))
%e A387180 So 90 is not in the sequence.
