%N A387043 Number of ways to write n as (1 + (n mod 2))*p + prime(k) + prime(k+1) + prime(k+2), where p is a prime and k is a positive integer.
%C A387043 Conjecture: (i) a(2*n) > 0 for all n > 12. In other words, any even number greater than 25 is the sum of a prime and three consecutive primes.
%C A387043 (ii) a(2*n+1) > 0 for all n > 135. In other words, any odd number greater than 272 can be written as the sum of twice a prime and three consecutive primes.
%C A387043 It seems that 80 is the largest even number m with a(m) = 1 and 511 is the largest odd number n with a(n) = 1.
