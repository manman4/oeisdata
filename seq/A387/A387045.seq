%N A387045 Nonnegative numbers k for which there is no largest circle enclosing exactly k points (strictly inside) on a square grid, only a least upper bound on that circle size.
%C A387045 A circle enclosing exactly k points always exists, but the set of circle sizes enclosing exactly k points might have a maximum (A387044), or might only have a least upper bound.
%C A387045 Conjecture: This sequence is infinite.

%e A387045 5 is a term since there are circles strictly smaller than radius sqrt(10)/2 but arbitrarily close to it which enclose exactly 5 points; but at sqrt(10)/2 or greater they cannot, so no largest circle, only a least upper bound (sqrt(10)/2).
