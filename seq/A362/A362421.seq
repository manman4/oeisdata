%N A362421 Number of nonisomorphic vector spaces consisting of n elements.
%C A362421 If n is a prime power p^k, then a vector space consisting of n elements has the form (F_(p^d))^(k/d) where d is a divisor of k.

%F A362421 a(n) = a(p^k) = sigma_0(k) if n = p^k is a prime power, a(n) = 0 otherwise.
%e A362421 a(16) = 3 because 16=2^4 and 4 has 3 divisors.
