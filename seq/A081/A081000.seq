%N A081000 n is a member if and only if it ranks among top n positive integers in centrality (cf. A080997 for fuller description of this concept).
%C A081000 1, 2, 3, 4, 21 and 27 are currently the only known examples of n that rank exactly n-th in centrality; it is not known whether there are others.
%F A081000 The formula for the centrality of an integer is A018804(n)/n^2; see also A080997.
%Y A081000 Cf. A080997, A080998, also A081029, the highly central integers (a subset of this sequence). Complement is A081001.
