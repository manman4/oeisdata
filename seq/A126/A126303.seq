%N A126303 a(n) = number of nodes with odd distance to the root in the n-th plane general tree encoded by A014486(n). Both internal and terminal nodes (leaves) are counted.
%e A126303 A014486(27) = 696 (1010111000 in binary), encodes the following general plane tree, where the root is marked with * and nodes with even or odd distance to root with 'e's and 'o's, respectively.
