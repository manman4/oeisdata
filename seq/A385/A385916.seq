%N A385916 Positive integers m that form Gaussian integers m + i such that every Gaussian integer g with |g| <= |m + i| is a linear combination of the distinct Gaussian divisors of m + i (where i is the imaginary unit).
%C A385916 This sequence is an example of extending the concept of a practical number to the domain of Gaussian integers. To determine if a Gaussian integer p is practical over the Gaussian integer domain it is necessary to show that the Gaussian divisors (including all their associates) of the Gaussian integer p when combined linearly and distinctly generate all Gaussian integers g where |g| <= |p|.
%C A385916 The Mathematica program in the link below gives a complex plot of the linear combinations of the distinct divisors of a Gaussian integer m + i to see if it is a member of this sequence.
%C A385916 An analogous sequence such that positive integers m that form the Gaussian integers m + i are prime is given by A005574.

%e A385916 a(3) is in the sequence because the Gaussian divisors of 3 + i are 1, 1 + i, 1 + 2i, 3 + i. Each divisor has 3 other associates. In total these 16 divisors will give the complex plot below when they are combined linearly and distinctly. Note that the patten in any quadrant is a rotation by a right angle of its adjacent quadrant.
