%N A385537 Indices k such that the repunit (10^k-1)/9 is coprime with any other nonzero binary vector of the same length in base 10.
%C A385537 k is a term iff A378511(k) <= 1.
%C A385537 k is a term iff A385539(k) <= 1.
%C A385537 a(n) contains all indices of prime repunits A004023 as a subsequence.
%C A385537 If A378199(k) <= 1, then k is a term in this sequence, however the inverse is not true. The smallest counterexample is k = 19.
%C A385537 a(11) >= 59. - _Michael S. Branicky_, Jul 03 2025
%F A385537 A385579(a(n)) = 1.
%e A385537 0 is a term because A002275(0) = 0, which is coprime with the only other binary vector of the same length, which is 1.
%e A385537 1 is a term because A002275(1) = 1, there are no other nonzero binary vectors of length 1, and any statement about the elements of an empty set is true.
%e A385537 2 is a term because 11 is a repunit prime.
%e A385537 3 is a term because 111=3*37 is coprime with all other nonzero binary vectors of length 3, which are 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110. None of them is divisible by 3 or 37.
%e A385537 Counterexample: 4 is not a term because the repunit 1111 is not coprime with 1100. They are both divisible by 11.
