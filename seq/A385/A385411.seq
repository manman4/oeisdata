%N A385411 Numbers k that are not perfect powers, not divisible by some b, and whose trailing digits form a power of b, where 1 < b < k.

%e A385411 Numbers having a single digit are not terms:
%e A385411   k=1..2 are not terms since b < k could not be a valid base;
%e A385411   Numbers k=3..9 are not in the sequence since there is not b < k with the same digit of k.
%e A385411 10 is not a term since it ends in a single zero, and zero is not a power of another number.
%e A385411 a(1) = 11 since it is a prime and 11 mod 10 = 1 = b^0 for all bases b in [10] \ 1.
%e A385411 12 is not a term since for all 1 < b < 12 either b | 12 or 12 mod 10 = 2 <> b^e, with e > 0.
%e A385411 a(2) = 13 since it is a prime and 13 mod 10 is a power of 3.
%e A385411 All primes p greater than 7 are terms since they are not perfect powers and are not divisible by 1 < b < p.
%e A385411 20 is not a term because it ends with a zero, and zero is not a power of another number.
%e A385411 26 is a term since it is not a perfect power, 6 does not divide 26, and 26 mod 10 = 6^1.
%e A385411 116 is a term since it is not a perfect power (116 = 2^2*29), 16 does not divide 116, and 116 mod 100 = 16^1.
