%N A385816 The number k such that the k-th composition in standard order lists the maximal anti-run lengths of the binary indices of n. Standard composition number of row n of A384877.
%C A385816 A binary index of n is any position of a 1 in its reversed binary expansion. The binary indices of n are row n of A048793.
%C A385816 The k-th composition in standard order (graded reverse-lexicographic, A066099) is obtained by taking the set of positions of 1's in the reversed binary expansion of k, prepending 0, taking first differences, and reversing again. This gives a bijective correspondence between nonnegative integers and integer compositions.
%C A385816 If the k-th composition in standard order is y, then the standard composition number of y is defined to be k.

%e A385816 The binary indices of 181 are {1,3,5,6,8}, with maximal anti-runs ((1,3,5),(6,8)), with lengths (3,2), which is the 18th composition in standard order, so a(181) = 18.
