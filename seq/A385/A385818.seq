%N A385818 The number k such that the k-th composition in standard order lists the maximal run lengths of each nonnegative integer's binary indices, with duplicates removed.
%C A385818 A permutation of the nonnegative integers.
%C A385818 A binary index of n is any position of a 1 in its reversed binary expansion. The binary indices of n are row n of A048793.
%C A385818 The k-th composition in standard order (graded reverse-lexicographic, A066099) is obtained by taking the set of positions of 1's in the reversed binary expansion of k, prepending 0, taking first differences, and reversing again. This gives a bijective correspondence between nonnegative integers and integer compositions.

%e A385818 The binary indices of 53 are {1,3,5,6}, with maximal runs ((1),(3),(5,6)) with lengths (1,1,2), which is the 14th composition in standard order, so A385889(53) = 14, and after removing duplicate rows a(16) = 14.

%Y A385818 The compositions themselves are listed by A385817.
%Y A385818 Before removing duplicates we had A385889.
%Y A385818 A245563 lists run lengths of binary indices (ranks A246029), rev A245562, strict A328592.
%Y A385818 A384175 counts subsets with all distinct lengths of maximal runs, complement A384176.
