%N A385176 Positive half of inverse speed permutation array. Square array A(n,k), n >= 0, k >= 0, read by ascending antidiagonals.
%C A385176 Particles labeled with nonzero integers j start at time t = 0 at x = 2k (offset from the origin) on a straight line. Each particle, j, moves at speed -1/j, so crosses the origin at time t = 2j^2. T(n,k) gives the label of the particle in the line segment (2k, 2k+2) at time t = 2n+1.
%C A385176 It is easy to determine that particles labeled i and -j cross at x = 2*(i-j) at time t = 2ij, and that (for t > 0) a particle crosses x = 2k only when encountering a particle heading in the opposite direction. So at t = 2n+1 there is exactly one particle in each segment (2k, 2k+2) and the particle labels define a bi-infinite permution of the nonzero integers. For the terms of this sequence, we restrict k >= 0; and taking the absolute values of the terms in each row gives a permutation of the positive integers. Moreover, the differences between row n-1 and row n consist of exchanges of paired divisors of -n.
%C A385176 The halved positions, k, at which particles encounter a segment boundary x = 2k at t = 2n are given by row n of A368312. So when that row starts with a 0, this indicates a particle crossing the origin. On the other hand, the nonzero terms, k, of row t of A211343 indicate the segment midpoints x = 2k-1 that are encountered by particles at time t, with terms in odd (respectively even) columns corresponding to positive-labeled (respectively negative-labeled) particles.
