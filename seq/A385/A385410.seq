%N A385410 Multiples k of b that are not perfect powers and whose trailing digits form a power of b, where 1 < b < k.

%e A385410 In general, no prime p is a term since they are a power of base p.
%e A385410 Numbers having a single digit are not terms:
%e A385410   1 is not a term since 1 is a power of all bases b;
%e A385410   Composites 4, 6, and 9 are not in the sequence since 4 = 2^2, 6 = 2*3, and 9 = 3^2.
%e A385410 10 is not a term since it ends in a single zero, and zero is not a power of another number.
%e A385410 a(1) = 12 since it is not a perfect power, 2 | 12, and 12 mod 10 is a power of 2.
%e A385410 a(2) = 14 since it is not a perfect power, 2 | 14, and 14 mod 10 is a power of 2.
%e A385410 20 is not a term since it ends with a zero, and zero is not a power of another number.
%e A385410 26 is not a term since 6 does not divide 26.
%e A385410 1100 is a term since it is not a perfect power, 100 = 100^1, and 100 | 1100.
