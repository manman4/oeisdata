%N A385155 Numbers z such that there exist two integers 0<x<y<z such that (1/sigma(x) + 1/sigma(y) + 1/sigma(z))*(x + y + z) = 3.
%C A385155 The numbers x, y and z form a HM(1,3)-amicable triple (HM = harmonic mean). See Dimitrov link. An amicable triple forms a HM(1,3)-amicable triple, so the larger member of an amicable triple A125492 is a term of this sequence.
%C A385155 From _David A. Corneth_, Jun 20 2025: (Start)
%C A385155 Let sx = sigma(x), sy = sigma(y) and sz = sigma(z).
%C A385155 We may write (1/sx + 1/sy + 1/sz)*(x + y + z) = (1/sx + 1/sy) * (x + y) + 1/sz * (x + y + z) + z * (1/sx + 1/sy). As z > y > x we have 2 * z > x + y so z > (x + y) / 2.
%C A385155 Therefore we have 3 = (1/sx + 1/sy) * (x + y) + 1/sz * (x + y + z) + z * (1/sx + 1/sy) > 1.5*(1/sx + 1/sy) * (x + y) + 1/sz * (x + y + z) > 1.5*(1/sx + 1/sy) * (x + y) and so (1/sx + 1/sy) * (x + y) < 2. Possibly 2 could be tightened due to 1/sz * (x + y + z) which is discarded for now.
%C A385155 If we know (1/sx + 1/sy) * (x + y) < U for some U then similarly x/s(x) can be tightened to 0.5*U and maybe more due to term 1/sy * (x + y).
%C A385155 Furthermore 3 = (1/sx + 1/sy + 1/sz)*(x + y + z) > 1/sx * (x + y + z) > 1/sx * (x + y + y) = 1/sx * (x + 2*y) which constraints y and later on z once 1/sx is known.
%C A385155 For every pair (k, m) in {(x, y), (x, z), (y, z)} from solutions (x, y, z) where z <= 10000 we have (k + m) * (1/sigma(k) + 1/sigma(m)) <= 1.5. Is that the case for every solution? (End).

%e A385155 (840, 1020, 1380) is such a triple because (1/sigma(840) + 1/sigma(1020) + 1/sigma(1380))*(840 + 1020 + 1380) = 3.
