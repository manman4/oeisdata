%N A385480 Sum of the orders of every automorphism group of order n.
%C A385480 Let G be a group of order n, let N = {1, 2, ..., n}, and let f: G -> N be a bijection whereby f(G) = I is an index set of G. An automorphism phi of G is a permutation of N via f(phi(G)). It is tempting to ask the question 'how many permutations of N obey the group laws?'. However this question is not well-defined since it would require there being a natural single choice of bijection for every group of order n, which in general does not exist. Enumerating permutations of N which are automorphisms for every isomorphism class G will therefore depend on the choice of bijection for G. a(n) is the upper bound for all such enumerations of permutations of size n since a(n) is either: the maximum enumeration when the choice of bijections ensures that all permutations are distinct; or a(n) is the enumeration including all multiplicities when the choice of bijections leads to permutations which are not distinct.
%F A385480 a(n) is the sum of the k-th row in A137316.
%e A385480 a(3) = 2 since for the one group of order 3, C_3, |Aut(C_3)| = 2.
%e A385480 a(4) = 8 since for the two groups of order 4, C_4 and C_2 x C_2, |Aut(C_4)| + |Aut(C_2 x C_2)| = 2 + 6 = 8.
%e A385480 a(8) = 212 since for the five groups of order 8, the sum of the orders of their automorphism groups is 4 + 8 + 8 + 24 + 168 = 212.
