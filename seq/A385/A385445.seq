%N A385445 Decimal expansion of (-1 + 3*phi)*sqrt(3 - phi), with the golden section phi = A001622.
%C A385445 This constant c gives the real part of -2*11*Z = (c + d*i), where Z is the (finite) fixed point of a complex function w (of the loxodromic type) mapping iteratively the vertices of golden triangles, starting with vertices (D_1, D_2, D_3), circumscribed by the unit circle with center at the origin, and D_1 = i, D_2 = (s - phi*i)/2 and D_3 = (-s - phi*i)/2. This function is w(z) = a*z + b, with a = (-1 + phi) * exp(-(3*Pi/5)*i) = -((2 - phi) + s*i)/2 and b = (1 - phi)*i, where s = sqrt(3 - phi) = A182007 (the length of the base (D_2, D_3) of the first triangle, also called s_1).
%C A385445 The imaginary part of -2*11*Z is d = -7 + 10*phi = A385446.
%C A385445 If the fixed point Z = -(0.20594... + 0.41728...*i) is chosen as origin then the loxodromic map is W(z') = a*z' (where z' = z - Z and W(z') = w(z'+Z) - Z).
%C A385445 For details see the linked paper, eqs.(5a,b) for w(z), eq.(6) for Z and eq.(7) for W(z'). (In eq.(5b) the i is missing in the exponent.) The nesting of golden triangles as shown in Fig. 1 of the link leads to the fixed point Z.
%C A385445 The vertices of the nested golden triangles can be connected by a spiral built of circular sections with angle 108 degrees, centered at vertices D_{n+3} and shrinking radii s_n =(- 1 + phi)^(n-1)*s. Note that the curvature of this spiral is not continuous.
%C A385445 The length(Z, D_n) =: rho_n of the spokes of the spiral is (-1 + phi)^(n-1)*rho_1, with sqrt(11)*rho_1 = sqrt(8 + 9*phi) = sqrt(5 + 7*phi)*s = A385447.
%C A385445 For the length ratio rho_1/s see A385448.
%C A385445 The logarithmic spiral connecting the vertices D_{n+1} is given in polar coordinates by rho(Phi) = rho_1 * exp((-(5/(3*Pi)) * log(phi)*Phi), with the vertices obtained in polar coordinates for Phi = Phi_n = (3*Pi/5)*n, namely rho(Phi_n) = rho_{n+1}, for n >= 0. For log(phi) see A002390. Note that the nonnegative x-axis is now along Z, D_1. The angle(Z, D1, D4) =: gamma is given by arctan((18 - 11*phi)/s) = arcsin(rho_4 / 2) = 0.169860704... or 9.7323... degrees. See Fig. 3 of the linked paper.
