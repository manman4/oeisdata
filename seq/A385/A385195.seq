%F A385195 Multiplicative with a(p^e) = 2 if p = 2 and e = 1, and p^e - 1 otherwise.
%F A385195 In general, the number of integers k from 1 to n such that ugcd(n, k), the greatest divisor of k that is a unitary divisor of n, is either 1 or a prime power q is a multiplicative function f(n) with f(p^e) = q if p^e = q, and p^e - 1 otherwise.
%F A385195 a(n) = A138191(n) * A047994(n), i.e., a(n) = 2*A047994(n) if n == 2 (mod 4) and A047994(n) otherwise.
%F A385195 In general, the number of integers k from 1 to n such that ugcd(n, k) is either 1 or a prime power q is (q/(q-1))*A047994(n) if q is a unitary divisor of n, and A047994(n) otherwise.
%F A385195 Sum_{k=1..n} a(k) ~ (23/40) * c * n^2, where c = Product_{p prime} (1 - 1/(p*(p+1))) = A065463.
%F A385195 In general, the average order of the number of integers k from 1 to n such that ugcd(n, k) is either 1 or a prime p is ((p^4+p^3-1)/(p^4+p^3-p^2)) * c * n^2 / 2, where c = A065463.
%e A385195 For n = 6, the greatest divisor of k that is a unitary divisor of 6 for k = 1 to 6 is 1, 2, 3, 2, 1 and 6, respectively. 4 of the values are either 1 or 2, and therefore a(6) = 4.
