%N A385081 Irregular triangle T(n,k) of refined derangement counts in the symmetric group S_(n+1), refined per cycle type.
%C A385081 The triangle consists of selected entries from A181897.
%C A385081 Each permutation in the symmetric group S_N has a cycle type specified by an integer partition of N. We encode a partition of N as an N-tuple of multiplicities of j=1..N; e.g., the partition 8 = 1+1+2+4 is encoded as (2,1,0,1,0,0,0,0), abbreviated (2,1,0,1). In general (m_j: j=1..N), and this partition corresponds to a cycle type (a)(b)(cd)(efgh) in S_8. Derangements have no fixed points, hence correspond to partitions with no addends of 1; i.e., m_1=0. A181897 counts all permutations via cycle type (not just derangements), with the partitions ordered reverse lexicographically in terms of their multiplicities N-tuples. E.g., partitions of 4 are ordered: (4), (2,1), (1,0,1), (0,0,0,1). In fact, the columns of A181897 (as a triangular array) are scaled columns of binomial coefficients binomial(p,q) with q fixed for each column, scaled by the entries in this listing (see new comment in A181897 for details).
%C A385081 The number of terms in the n-th row of this irregular triangle is given by p(n+1)-p(n) where p(n) = A000041(n) is the partitions counting function. The row sum of row n is A000166(n+1). The number of 'parts' of a partition P is K(P) := Sum_{j=1..N} m_j; if this sequence is signed by (-1)^(1+N+K), then the signed sum of row n is equal to n. The last entry in row n is n!. The first entry in odd rows n is equal to n!!. The first entry in even rows n is equal to n*(n+1)!!/3.

%F A385081 Given a partition P of N encoded as its multiplicities N-tuple (m_j: j=1..N) with K(P) = Sum_{j=1..N} m_j 'parts'. Define P! := Product_{j=1..N} j^m_j.  Then the number of permutations in the symmetric group S_N of cycles type labelled by P is #P = multinomial(K(P); (m_j){j=1..N}) * N! / (P! * K(P)!), as stated in A181897 by Carlos Mafra.
