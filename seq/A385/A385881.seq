%N A385881 Algebraic rank of elliptic curve y^2 = x^3 - n*x - n.
%C A385881 Terms from n = 43 onward are the analytic ranks (see PARI code) of the corresponding elliptic curves. By the BSD conjecture, these are expected to equal the algebraic ranks. Thus, the validity of these terms is conditional on BSD.
%H A385881 LMFDB, <a href="https://www.lmfdb.org/EllipticCurve/Q/368/g/1">y^2 = x^3 - x - 1</a>.
%e A385881 a(1) = 0 because y^2 = x^3 - x - 1 has rank 0.
