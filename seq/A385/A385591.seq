%N A385591 Numbers k such that both k^3 - 1 and k^3 + 1 are triprimes.
%C A385591 Numbers k such that k^3 - 1 and k^3 + 1 each have 3 prime factors, counted with multiplicity.
%C A385591 All terms are divisible by 6.
%C A385591 The Generalized Bunyakovsky Conjecture implies there are infinitely many j such that 6+7*j, 32 + 35*j, 1225 * j^2 + 2205 * j + 993 and 175 * j^2 + 305 * j + 133 are all prime.  For such j, 31 + 35*j is a term of the sequence.  Thus the conjecture implies the sequence is infinite. The first two such j are 1 and 31, corresponding to a(1) = 66 and a(20) = 1116.
