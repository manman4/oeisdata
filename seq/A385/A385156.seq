%N A385156 The number of undirected, simple, unlabeled graphs G on n vertices which are prime, not split, and do not contain a vertex of degree 1 in G or in the complement of G, and has no induced P5 in G or in the complement of G.
%C A385156 Here, "prime" means with respect to modular decomposition (see link). A P5 is a path on 5 vertices. A split graph is a graph whose vertices can be partitioned into a clique and an independent set. Related to conjectures in the referenced paper.
