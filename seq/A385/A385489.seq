%N A385489 Positive integers m such that every Gaussian integer g with |g| <= m is a linear combination of the distinct Gaussian divisors of m.
%C A385489 Practical numbers (A005153) are defined over Z+. A generalization of practical numbers over Z are known as "semi-practical" numbers (A363227). This sequence is a further generalization over the Gaussian integers.
%C A385489 It is assumed that all "semi-practical" numbers are members of this sequence.
%C A385489 The Mathematica program in the link below gives a complex plot of the linear combinations of the distinct divisors of a positive integer to see if it is a member of this sequence.

%e A385489 a(5) is in the sequence because the Gaussian divisors of 5 are 1, 1+2i, 2+i, 5. Each divisor has 3 other associates. In total these 16 divisors will give the complex plot below when they are combined linearly and distinctly. 5 is not a "semi-practical" number. Note also that every similar complex plot will give a pattern with the same number of axes of symmetry as that of a square.
