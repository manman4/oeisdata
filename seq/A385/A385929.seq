%N A385929 Number of simple, undirected, prime graphs G on n unlabeled vertices with no degree-1 vertex in G or its complement, as well as having no induced P5 in G or in its complement.
%C A385929 Here, "prime" means with respect to modular decomposition (see link). A P5 is a path on 5 vertices.

%e A385929 The only such graph on n=5 is the C5. The only such graph on n=8 is the split graph called the 4-sun (see the House of Graphs link).
%Y A385929 Cf. A079473, A385693, A385697.
