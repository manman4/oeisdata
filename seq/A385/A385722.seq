%N A385722 a(n) = the n-th term of the sequence B_2 defined as the ordered union of the ranges of A_x, where the sequence A_x is defined in A384669, and x is a proper positive fraction with denominator 2, 3, 4, or 6.
%C A385722 The sequences A_x were defined in A384669; please see that sequence for more details.
%C A385722 Because of the continuity of the functions g_k(x) defined in A384669, if k is a term of A_y, then k is a term of A_x with x rational sufficiently close to y; so it suffices to study A_x for x rational, 0 < x < 1.
%C A385722 Let x = p/q, with p and q natural numbers, p < q. Then B_n is the ordered union of the ranges of A_x, where q has Euler totient <= n (that is, A000010(q) <= n). B_1 is just the sequence A_(1/2), that is, A384669. The present sequence B_2 is the ordered union of the ranges of A_x, where x = 1/6, 1/4, 1/3, 1/2, 2/3, 3/4, 5/6.
%C A385722 8 is the first term in B_2 (this sequence) that is not in B_1 = A384669.
%C A385722 15120 appears to be the first term in B_4 that is not in B_2 (this sequence).
%C A385722 More discussion about B_n and B_oo appears in a linked pdf.

%e A385722 8 is a term of A_(2/3) and therefore of this sequence as well as A_x for x > 2/3, even though 8 is not a term of A384669, because 3^(2/3) (corresponding to 8) > 2 = 1^(2/3) + 1^(2/3) (corresponding to 6). Thus 8 qualifies to be a term in B_2, this sequence.
