%N A385412 Numbers k that are not perfect powers and whose trailing digits form a power of b, where 1 < b < k.

%e A385412 Numbers having a single digit are not terms:
%e A385412   1 is not a term since 1 is a power of all bases b;
%e A385412   Numbers k=2..9 are not in the sequence since k^e mod 10 <> b, with e > 1.
%e A385412 10 is not a term since it ends in a single zero, and zero is not a power of another number.
%e A385412 a(1) = 11 since it is a prime and 11 mod 10 is a power of all bases b.
%e A385412 a(2) = 12 since it is not a perfect power, and 12 mod 10 is a power of 2.
%e A385412 a(3) = 13 since it is a prime and 13 mod 10 is a power of 3.
%e A385412 All primes p greater than 7 are terms since they are not perfect powers.
%e A385412 20 is not a term because it ends with a zero, and zero is not a power of another number.
%e A385412 26 is a term since it is not a perfect power, and 26 mod 10 = 6^1.
