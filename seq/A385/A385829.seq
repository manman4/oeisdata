%N A385829 Numbers k that are the largest k such that k cannot be partitioned into parts that are a set of at least two consecutive primes.
%C A385829 If we consider partitions into one distinct prime then no such largest number k exists.

%e A385829 1 is a term as it is the largest positive integer that cannot be partitioned into parts 2 and 3. We have 2 = 2, 3 = 3 and so any positive integer at least two can be partitioned into parts 2 and 3.
%e A385829 30 is a term as 30 is the largest number that cannot be partitions into parts 7, 11 and 13. Proof:
%e A385829 30 cannot be written as a partition of 7, 11, 13 and we have 31 = 7 + 11 + 13, 32 = 3*7 + 11, 33 = 3*11, 34 = 3*7 + 13, 35 = 5*7, 36 = 2*7 + 2*11, 37 = 11 + 2*13 which proves that the next 7 positive integers after 30 can be partitioned into parts 7, 11, 13. Any larger number than that can have more sevens added.
