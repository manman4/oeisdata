%N A385847 Decimal expansion of the length of the chord in a circle (in units of the diameter) that splits the area into one and two thirds.
%C A385847 A chord length c and the area A of the circular segment are related by A = Pi^2*[arcsin x - x *sqrt(1-x^2)] where x = c/(2r) is the chord length divided by diameter 2r.
%C A385847 Setting A = Pi^2*r/3 yields this constant here. Setting A=Pi^2*r/2 gives x=1: a chord through the circle center splits the area into two halves.
%C A385847 arccos(x) = 0.268133... rad = 15.36291.. deg is the angle between the chord and the line through the circle center (that cuts it in half) measured at the point where the chord and the line intersect the circle.
%F A385847 Root of arcsin(x) -x * sqrt(1-x^2) = Pi/3.
%e A385847 0.96426707428389728406 ... = 1.928534148567794... / 2 .
