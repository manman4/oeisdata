%N A385513 The numbers of people in the "SpellUnder-Down" variant of the Josephus problem such that the last person is freed.
%C A385513 In SpellUnder-Down dealing, we spell the number of the next card, putting a card under for each letter in the number, then we deal the next card. So we start with putting 3 cards under, for O-N-E, then deal, then 3 under for T-W-O, then deal, then 5 under for T-H-R-E-E, then deal. The dealing sequence is highly irregular because it depends on English spelling. The dealing pattern starts: UUUDUUUDUUUUUD. In the corresponding Josephus problem, we skip the next person for each under dealing, and eliminate the next person for each down dealing.
%C A385513 This sequence can be used in magic tricks with the SpellUnder-Down dealing pattern. The deck sizes in this sequence guarantee that after the dealing, the last card dealt is the one that was initially on the bottom.
%C A385513 The classical Josephus problem corresponds to under-down dealing. In this case, the last person is freed when the number of people is a power of 2 minus 1.
%C A385513 A naive probabilistic argument predicts the probability that A380204(k) = k is 1/k and expects this sequence to be infinite and distributed roughly as A002387. - _Michael S. Branicky_, Jul 24 2025

%e A385513 Suppose there are 5 people in a circle. We start with skipping three people for O-N-E. After three people are skipped, the person number 4 is eliminated. The leftover people are 5,1,2,3 in order. Then we skip three people for T-W-O. The person number 3 eliminated, and the leftover people are 5,1,2 in order. Then we skip 5 people for T-H-R-E-E, and person number 2 is eliminated, and the leftover people are 5,1 in order. Then we skip four people for F-O-U-R. person number 5 is eliminated. Person 1 is freed. As person 1 is not last, 5 is NOT in this sequence.
