%N A385525 Consider the graph whose vertices are the points of the n-dimensional cubic lattice with points connected by all integer-length diagonals that traverse all n dimensions and do not intersect intermediate points. a(n) is the total length of the shortest possible closed walk in this graph via noncongruent diagonals of the same length.
%C A385525 Other than a(2) whose walk is comprised of 8 diagonal segments, all known terms are produced by 3- or 4-segment walks, including some with examples of both. It is conjectured that this holds true for all n >= 3.
%C A385525 For n = 2, the walk segments are the hypotenuses of noncongruent primitive Pythagorean triangles.
%C A385525 The offset is 2, because even though the graph could be defined in dimension 1 (the vertices would be the points of Z, with each point connected to its two neighbors), it would not contain any closed paths.
%C A385525 Removing the constraint that the diagonal segments must all have the same length gives A386251. All such walks in 2 dimensions, by diagonal segment length rather than total walk length, gives A386671.
