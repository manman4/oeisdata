%N A385730 The number of lattice points in the 2D plane contained between the curve y=x^2/4 and the line y=n^2, inclusive, where n is a positive integer.
%C A385730 This sequence came about by trying to study the probability that a quadratic equation x^2+bx+c=0 has real roots.
%C A385730 Proven directly by summation and using the symmetry of the problem.
%C A385730 Inspired by YouTube video by Michael Penn where he considered the probability of real roots for all real b and c. This sequence comes from the case of considering the probability that the quadratic equation has real roots when b and c are restricted to be integers

%F A385730 a(n) = (1/3)*(8 * n^3 + 7 * n + 3).
%e A385730 For n=1, there are 6 lattice points contained between the curve y=x^2/4 and the line y=1, inclusive. They are (0,0), (-2,1), (-1,1), (0,1), (1,1) and (2,1).
