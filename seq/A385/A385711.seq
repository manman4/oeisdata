%N A385711 Primes whose digits are all distinct and pairwise coprime.
%C A385711 This sequence has 252 terms, the last being 95471, which have at most 5 digits. This is because each term has at most one even digit and at most 4 odd digits, since gcd(3, 9) = 3.
%C A385711 All terms are in A038618, since if zero is among the digits of a prime p, then p must have at least 3 digits, where at least one of them is greater than 1, say d, and in such a case gcd(0, d) = d ! = 1.
