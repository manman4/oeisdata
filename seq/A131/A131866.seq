%N A131866 Distance of n-th semiprime to nearest square.
%C A131866 This to semiprimes A001358 as A047972 is to primes A000040.
%C A131866 For each semiprime, find the closest square (preceding or succeeding); subtract, take absolute value.

%F A131866 a(n) = A053188(A001358(n)). [corrected by _R. J. Mathar_, Nov 19 2007]
%e A131866 a(1) = 0 because the first semiprime is 4, which is a square.
%e A131866 a(2) = 2 because the 2nd semiprime is 6 and |6-4| = 2 where 4 is the nearest square to 6.
%e A131866 a(3) = 0 because the 3rd semiprime is 9, which is a square.
%e A131866 a(4) = 1 because the 4th semiprime is 10 and |10-9| = 1 where 9 is the nearest square to 10.
