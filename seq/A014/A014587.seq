%C A014587 Concerning the January 1997 dissertation of Achim Flammenkamp, his home page (currently http://wwwhomes.uni-bielefeld.de/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/achim/index.cgi) has the link shown below, and a comment that a book was published in July 1997 by Hans-Jacobs-Verlag, Lage, Germany with the title Lange Perioden in Subtraktions-Spielen (ISBN 3-932136-10-1). This is an enlarged study (more than 200 pages) of his dissertation. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Jul 25 2019

%F A014587 Conjecture: Appears to be periodic with period of length 25 =  [0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 2, 3] starting with the initial term (there is no preamble). - _Michel Dekking_, Jul 26 2019
%F A014587 This conjecture is false, because moving from 10! = 3628800 to 0 is a legal move, and so a(3628800) cannot be zero. A similar argument shows that for no value of P is this sequence periodic with period P starting at term 0 (for a(P!) cannot be zero). - _Nathan Fox_, Jul 28 2019.
%F A014587 The first counterexample to the conjecture above is a(5050) = 4. - _Pontus von Br√∂mssen_, Jul 09 2022
