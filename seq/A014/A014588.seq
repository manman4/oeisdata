%N A014588 Nim function for Take-a-Fibonacci-Game (a subtraction game).
%C A014588 This game is also called Fibonacci nim, but there is also a different game with the same name. Its winning positions (the indexes of zeros in this sequence) are A001581 and its (much sparser) odd winning positions are A120904. - _David Eppstein_, Jun 14 2018
