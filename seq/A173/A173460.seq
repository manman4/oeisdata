%N A173460 Number of "ON" cells at n-th stage in simple 2-dimensional cellular automaton (see Comments for precise definition).
%C A173460 On the infinite square grid, we start at stage 0 with all cells in OFF state. At stage 1, we turn ON a single cell, in the central position.
%C A173460 In order to construct this sequence we use the following rules:
%C A173460 - If n is congruent to 0 (mod 3), we turn "ON" the cells around the vertex of every convex corner formed in the structure at the generation n-1. Note that every vertex is surrounded by three new "ON" cells.
%C A173460 - If n is congruent to 1 (mod 3), we turn "ON" the possible bridge cells and the possible peninsula cells (For the definition of bridge cell and of peninsula cell see A160117).
%C A173460 - If n is congruent to 2 (mod 3), we turn "ON" the cells around the cells turned "ON" at the generation n-1.
%C A173460 - Everything that is already ON remains ON.
%C A173460 A173461, the first differences, gives the number of cells turned "ON" at n-th stage.
