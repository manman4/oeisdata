%N A167161 The Catapult Sequence.
%C A167161 This sequence is conjectured to be a permutation of the nonnegative integers, generated by the following process:
%C A167161 Begin with the nonnegative integers in their normal positions. Starting with n=0, the number in position n, which will be our a(n), "catapults" the neighbor to its right a(n) spaces further to the right. Increment n and repeat.
%C A167161 Whether or not this is actually a permutation of the nonnegative integers depends on whether or not there exists a number that is catapulted an infinite number of times. If such a number (say X) exists, the inverse "permutation" will be undefined at the X-th term.

%e A167161 Step 0: a(0)=0 catapults 1 a distance of 0 -> 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.
%e A167161 Step 1: a(1)=1 catapults 2 a distance of 1 -> 0,1,3,2,4,5,6,7,8.
%e A167161 Step 2: a(2)=3 catapults 2 a distance of 3 -> 0,1,3,4,5,6,2,7,8.
