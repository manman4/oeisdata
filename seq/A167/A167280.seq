%N A167280 Period length 12: 0,0,1,2,4,7,4,8,7,4,8,5 (and repeat).
%C A167280 The sum of the terms in the period is 50, so the partial sums of the sequence are also 12-periodic if reduced modulo 50 or modulo 10.
%C A167280 The weighted partial sums b(n) = Sum_{i=0..n} a(i)*2^i obey b(n) == b(n+12) (mod 10).
%C A167280 Third column is A000689. (Which table or array is this referring to? _R. J. Mathar_, Nov 01 2009)
%C A167280 The set of digits in the period is the same as in A141425.
%C A167280 A derived sequence with terms a(n)+a(n+6) has period length 6: 4, 8, 8, 6, 12, 12 (repeat).
%H A167280 <a href="/index/Rec#order_12">Index entries for linear recurrences with constant coefficients</a>, signature (0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1).
%F A167280 a(n) = A113405(n+1) mod 10.
