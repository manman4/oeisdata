%N A163500 a(n) is the smallest number x > 1 such that n appears as a substring of the decimal representations of the numbers [0..x] exactly x times.
%C A163500 This is an extension of a puzzle that a student posed as: Let f(x) be a function that counts the times the digit 1 appears in the decimal representations of the numbers from 0 to x. So, for example, f(11) is 4. For what number > 1 does f(x) = x? The answer to that question is 199981, the first term of this sequence. The sequence is the natural extension of this property. a(0) doesn't exist, because for any x, [0..x] (inclusive) contains zero, meaning there is at least one matching substring, and this is a monotonically increasing function. It is not clear that a(n) is defined for all n > 0, though the related sequence which uses f(x) > x rather than f(x) = x has at least less of a feeling of caprice about it. Multidigit numbers n are clearly at a disadvantage, but I have tried to phrase it, "appears as a substring" so that, for example, 11 appears in 1111 thrice rather than twice.
