%N A163311 Triangle read by rows in which the diagonals give the infinite set of Toothpick sequences.
%C A163311 Apart from the second diagonal (which gives the toothpick sequence A139250), the rest of the diagonals cannot be represented with toothpick structures. - _Omar E. Pol_, Dec 14 2016

%F A163311 See A162958 for rules governing the generation of N-th Toothpick sequences. By way of example, (N+2), A139250. The generator is A160552, which uses the multiplier "2". Then A160552 convolved with (1, 2, 2, 2,...) = A139250 the Toothpick sequence for N=2. Similarly, we create an array for Toothpick sequences N=1, 2, 3,...etc = A163267, A139250, A162958,...; then take the antidiagonals, creating triangle A163311.
