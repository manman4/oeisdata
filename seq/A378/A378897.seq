%N A378897 Number of integers that are neither squarefree nor prime powers between consecutive powerful numbers, exclusive of powerful numbers themselves.
%C A378897 Also the number of terms in A126706 between powerful terms, exclusive of powerful terms. Therefore 36, which is both in A126706 and in A001694, is not counted.

%F A378897 a(n) = A076446(n) - A378593(n) - 1 for n > 1.
%e A378897 Let s = A001694, powerful numbers.
%e A378897 Let t = A013929, nonsquarefree numbers.
%e A378897 a(1..3) = 0 since t(1) = 12 while s(1) = 1, s(2) = 4, s(3) = 8, and s(4) = 9.
%e A378897 a(4) = 1 since s(5) < t(1) < s(6), i.e., 9 < 12 < 16.
%e A378897 a(5) = 3 since between s(6) = 16 and s(7) = 25, we have t(2..4) = {18, 20, 24}.
%e A378897 a(6) = 0 since s(7) < 26 < s(8), where s(8) = 27, and 26 is squarefree.
%e A378897 a(7) = 1 since s(8) < t(5) < s(9), where t(5) = 28 and s(9) = 32,
%e A378897 a(8) = 0 since there are no nonsquarefree numbers between s(9) = 32 and s(10) = 36, etc.
