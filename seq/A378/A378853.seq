%N A378853 Define f(x) = abs(1-1/x) and sequence {b(m)} such that b(m+1) = f(b(m)). a(n) is the number of initial values b(1) such that {b(m)}'s period has length n.
%C A378853 Define oo by 1/oo = 0 and 1/0 = oo, therefore f(0) = oo, f(1) = 0, f(oo) = 1. (0, oo, 1) is a period of length 3 in {b(m)}, but we dismiss it in a(3) because it's concerned with non-real numbers.
%C A378853 Define f_k(x) by f_0(x) = x and f_k(x) = f(f_(k-1)(x)), therefore b(m+1) = f_m(b(1)).
%C A378853 We observe that the function f_k(x) is a piecewise fractional function, and we can prove by induction that each subfunction has the following properties:
%C A378853 1. The y-coordinates of each pair of endpoints must be either (0,1), (1,oo) or (oo,0).
%C A378853 2. Each subfunction is monotonic and continuous.
%C A378853 If {b(m)} has a period of length k, the function f_(k-1)(x) must intersect the line y=x at x=b(1). Note that each subfunction can intersect y=x at most one time; they intersect iff the subfunction's domain is within (0,1) and the y-coordinate of its endpoints is (0,1); or the subfunction's domain is within (1,oo) and the y-coordinate of its endpoints is (1,oo). Those can be proved by induction.
%C A378853 Therefore, we need to study an array separately on (0,1) and (1,oo).
%C A378853 On (0,1), the initial array is (0,1). After each iteration, 0 -> oo, 1 -> 0, oo -> 1. If 0 and oo are adjacent in the resulting array, put an 1 between them. The number of possible b(1)'s for period of length no more than n is given by the number of adjacent (0,1)'s and (1,0)'s in the array iterated (n-1) times. Denote it by x(n). x(1) = 1, x(2) = 2, x(n+2) = x(n) + x(n+1).
%C A378853 On (1,oo), the initial array is (1,oo). After each iteration, 0 -> oo, 1 -> 0, oo -> 1. If 0 and oo are adjacent in the resulting array, put an 1 between them. The number of possible b(1)'s for period of length no more than n is given by the number of adjacent (1,oo)'s and (oo,1)'s in the array iterated (n-1) times. Denote it by y(n). y(1) = 0, y(2) = 1, y(n+2) = y(n) + y(n+1).
%C A378853 Therefore, the total number of possible b(1)'s for period of length no more than n is x(n) + y(n) = L(n), where L(n) is the Lucas number A000032(n), i.e. Sum_{d|n} a(n) = L(n).
%C A378853 Lastly, using the Moebius inversion formula, we can get a(n) = Sum_{d|n} mu(d)*L(n/d). This is the formula for a(n) for cases except n=3, since we can prove that invalid periods of length n != 3 does not exist.
%C A378853 The idea and general proof are from 73Dsi.

%F A378853 a(3) = 0; a(n) = Sum_{d|n} mu(d)*L(n/d) if n != 3, where mu(n) is the Moebius function A008683(n), and L(n) is the Lucas number A000032(n).
%e A378853 For n = 1, only b(1) = (sqrt(5)-1)/2 is possible, so a(1) = 1;
%e A378853 For n = 3, there are no possible b(1)'s.
