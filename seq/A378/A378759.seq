%N A378759 Number of 1's required to build n using +, /, and ^.
%C A378759 All intermediate steps in building the number should also be integers.
%C A378759 A348262(n) >= a(n) >= A348089(n) for all n, as the available operators in A348262 are a subset of the available operators here, and the available operators here are a subset of the available operators in A348089.

%e A378759 a(14) = 9 because 14 = ((1+1+1)^(1+1+1)+1)/(1+1), which has 9 occurrences of the symbol "1", and there is no way of making 14 with fewer using these rules.
%e A378759 Note that A348262(14) = 10 because 14 = (1+1+1)^(1+1)+(1+1)^(1+1)+1; division allows for one fewer occurrence of the symbol "1" to be used here. Similarly, A348089(14) = 8, because 14 = (1+1)^(1+1)^(1+1)-(1+1); subtraction allows for one fewer occurrence of the symbol "1" to be used there. 14 is the least n such that A348262(n) > a(n) > A348089(n).
