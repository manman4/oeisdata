%N A378450 a(n) is the number of positive numbers k <= sigma(n) that are not a sum of any subset of distinct divisors of n.
%C A378450 Difference between the sum of divisors n and the number of distinct sums of distinct divisors of n.

%F A378450 a(n) = A000203(n) - A119347(n).
%e A378450 For n = 3, with divisors [1, 3] and sigma(3)=4, only 2 in range 1..4 cannot be represented as a sum of a subset of [1, 3], therefore a(3) = 1.
%e A378450 For n = 15, with divisors [1, 3, 5, 15] and sigma(15) = 24, the subset sums are 1, 3, 1+3, 5, 1+5, 3+5, 1+3+5, 15, 1+15, 3+15, 1+3+15, 5+15, 1+5+15, 3+5+15, 1+3+5+15 i.e., [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 23, 24], which leaves 2, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 17, 22 as unrepresented numbers, therefore a(15) = 9.
