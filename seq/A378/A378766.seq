%N A378766 Lexicographically earliest infinite sequence of distinct positive numbers with the property that n is a member of the sequence iff a(n) is powerful (in A001694).
%C A378766 The sequence is a list of indices m of powerful numbers a(m).
%C A378766 See comments in A379051 for more information.

%e A378766 a(1) = 1 since 1 is powerful, validating the appearance of 1 as an index of a powerful number in the sequence.
%e A378766 a(2) = 3 since self-referential 2 would prove false; 2 is not powerful, but 3 mandates a powerful number a(3).
%e A378766 a(3) = 4 since a(2) = 3, and 4 is the smallest powerful number that has not appeared.
%e A378766 a(4) = 8 since a(3) = 4, and 8 is the smallest powerful number that has not appeared.
%e A378766 a(5) = 6 since m = 5 has not appeared, and 6 is the smallest weak (nonpowerful, in A052485) number k > n.
%e A378766 a(6) = 9 since a(5) = 6, and 9 is the smallest powerful number that has not appeared, etc.
