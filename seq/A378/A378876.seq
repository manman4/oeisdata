%N A378876 a(1)=1; thereafter a(n) is the smallest k for which the subsequence a(n-k..n-1) has a distinct multiset from that of any other subsequence of the sequence thus far.
%C A378876 In other words, a(n) is the length of the shortest subsequence ending at a(n-1) which has a unique multiset among all multisets of subsequences of the sequence thus far. Alternatively, this is (the length of the longest subsequence ending at a(n-1) whose multiset has occurred before as that of another subsequence) plus 1.
%e A378876 a(15) = 6 because the length-6 subsequence a(9..14) =  3,3,2,2,2,3 has the shortest unique multiset, which does not occur elsewhere as the multiset of any other subsequence in the sequence thus far. No shorter subsequence ending in a(14) with a unique ordinal transform exists in the sequence thus far. For example, a(15) cannot be 5 because the length-5 subsequence a(10..14) = 3,2,2,2,3 has the same multiset as that of the subsequence a(9..13) = 3,3,2,2,2.
