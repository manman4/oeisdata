%N A378960 The biexponential mean of 2 and 3.
%C A378960 In an attempt to generalize the arithmetic mean (sum-based) and the geometric mean (product-based) to a similar construct for exponentiation, one can devise a simple definition using 2 interdependent sequences:
%C A378960   a_0 = u, b_0 = v,
%C A378960   a_n = exp(LambertW(log(a_{n-1}^b_{n-1}))),
%C A378960   b_n = exp(LambertW(log(b_{n-1}^a_{n-1}))), where u and v are the numbers for which we have to determine their biexponential mean.
%C A378960 The averaging operation is the square super-root of each of the 2 possible exponentiation orders to give out the successive term of each defining sequence. The square super-root of z is exp(LambertW(log(z))) for a particular branch of the LambertW function.
%C A378960 If a_n and b_n converge to a number z then the biexponential mean of u and v is z. It might be necessary to choose a particular branch of the LambertW function depending on the values of u and v (and that of log(u^v) and log(v^u)). This constant is based on the principal branch of the LambertW function.
