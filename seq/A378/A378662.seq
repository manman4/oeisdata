%N A378662 Number of divisors d of n such that sigma(d) <= 2*d < A003961(d), where A003961 is fully multiplicative with a(p) = nextprime(p).
%C A378662 Number of terms of A341614 that divide n.
%C A378662 Claim: a(n) > 0 if and only if A003961(n) > 2*n [i.e., n is in A246282]. That a(n) must be zero when n is in A246281 is obvious, as is also that a(n) > 0 when n is a term of A341614 [as then A378664(n) = n], but that a(n) > 0 for all abundant numbers (A005101) is slightly less clear. So the claim boils down to this: All abundant numbers have at least one (by necessity a proper) divisor d|n such that it is in A341614, i.e., sigma(d) <= 2*d < A003961(d), i.e., that for abundant numbers n, A337345(n) is always strictly greater than A080224(n). Equivalently, of the all nonabundant divisors d of an abundant number, at least one is primeshift-abundant, i.e., A003961(d) > 2*d. This has been proved Dec 11 2024 by _Jianing Song_ in A337372. The claim given in A378658 also follows from that proof.
