%N A378776 Lexicographically earliest sequence of positive integers such that each multiset enclosed by a pair of equal terms, including the endpoints, is distinct.
%C A378776 Note that we are considering multisets between every pair of equal values, not just those that appear consecutively.
%C A378776 Each positive integer occurs infinitely many times.
%C A378776 A new value is always followed by 1.
%C A378776 First differs from A366493 at a(19).

%e A378776 a(19) = 3: a(19) cannot be 1 because then a(15..19) = (1, 2, 3, 2, 1) would be the same multiset as a(6..10) = (2, 1, 3, 1, 2). a(19) cannot be 2 since this would make a(18-19) = (2,2), which is the same multiset as a(5-6). a(19) can be 3 since this does not create any repeat multiset.
