%N A378872 Discriminant of the minimal polynomial of a number whose continued fraction expansion has periodic part given by the n-th composition (in standard order).
%C A378872 Here, the minimal polynomial is required to have integer coefficients with no common divisors.
%C A378872 If two numbers have eventually periodic continued fraction expansions with the same periodic part, the discriminants of their respective minimal polynomials are the same.
%F A378872 a(n) = A378873(n)*A378874(n)^2.
%F A378872 a(A059893(n)) = a(n), since reversing the periodic part of a continued fraction leaves the discriminant unchanged.
%F A378872 a(A139706(n)) = a(n), since a circular shift of the periodic part of a continued fraction leaves the discriminant unchanged.
%e A378872 For n = 6, the 5th composition is (1,2). The value of the continued fraction 1+1/(2+1/(1+1/(2+...))) is (1+sqrt(3))/2, whose minimal polynomial is 2*x^2-2*x-1 with discriminant a(6) = 12.
