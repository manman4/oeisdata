%N A378881 Irregular triangle listing permutations of {1,...,m} which are at maximum distance from the identity permutation under steps rotate left (L) or exchange first two elements (E).
%C A378881 Permutations are listed for successive m >= 1 and in lexicographic order for multiple permutations in each m.
%C A378881 The maximum distance is A039745(m) and there may be multiple permutations at that distance.
%C A378881 The number of permutations at the maximum distance is A186144(m). - _Pontus von Br√∂mssen_, Dec 12 2024

%e A378881 For m=10 there is a single permutation at distance A039745(10) = 58, being row n=17,
%e A378881   3,1, 10,9,8,7,6,5,4, 2
%e A378881 This shows a pattern seen in even m ranging 6 <= m <= 12 where elements 2 and 3 are exchanged in what would otherwise be decreasing elements (with wrap-around).
%e A378881 For m=11 there are two permutations at distance A039745(11) = 71, being rows n=18 and n=19,
%e A378881   2,1, 11,10,9,8, 3,7,6,5,4

%e A378881                   \-------/
%e A378881 These show a pattern seen in odd m ranging 7 <= m <= 13 where the final (m-1)/2 elements are rotated left and right from what would otherwise be decreasing elements (with wrap-around).
