%N A378873 Squarefree part of A378872(n) (the discriminant of the minimal polynomial of a number whose continued fraction expansion has periodic part given by the n-th composition (in standard order)).
%C A378873 Any number x whose continued fraction expansion is eventually periodic can be written uniquely as x = (c+f*sqrt(d))/b, where b, c, f, d are integers, b > 0, d > 0 is squarefree, and GCD(b,c,f) = 1. a(n) is equal to d when the periodic part of the continued fraction of x is given by the n-th composition. If two numbers have eventually periodic continued fraction expansions with the same periodic part, their respective values of d are the same.

%F A378873 a(n) = A007913(A378872(n)) = A378872(n)/A378874(n)^2.
%F A378873 a(2^n) = A259912(n+1) if a(2^n) == 1 (mod 4), a(2^n) = A259912(n+1)/4 otherwise.
%F A378873 For n > k >= 0, a(2^n+2^k) = A259911(n,k+1) if a(2^n+2^k) == 1 (mod 4), a(2^n+2^k) = A259911(n,k+1)/4 otherwise.
%e A378873 For n = 6, the 5th composition is (1,2). The value of the continued fraction 1+1/(2+1/(1+1/(2+...))) is (1+sqrt(3))/2, so a(6) = 3.
