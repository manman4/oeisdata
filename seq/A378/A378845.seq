%N A378845 Smallest starting x which takes n steps to reach the minimum of a cycle in the 3x-1 iteration.
%C A378845 Each step is x -> 3x-1 if x odd, or x -> x/2 if x even (A001281).
%C A378845 The number of steps is A135730(x) so that a(n) = x is the smallest x for which A135730(x) = n.
%C A378845 a(n) <= 2*a(n-1) since x = 2*a(n-1) is a candidate for a(n) by first step x -> x/2.
%C A378845 Even terms are always a(n) = 2*a(n-1) since any smaller even a(n) would imply a smaller a(n-1) after first step x -> x/2.
%C A378845 No term is of the form 12*k+4, since its first step to 6*k+2 is also where the first step from 2*k+1 goes and the latter is a smaller start.
%C A378845 a(n) >= (a(n-1) + 1)/3 is a lower bound since a(n) = x must at least have a first step 3x-1 which reaches somewhere with n-1 further steps, so 3x-1 >= a(n-1).
%C A378845 Equality a(n) = (a(n-1) + 1)/3 = x occurs iff that x is an odd integer and not a cycle minimum, so its first step is to 3x-1 = a(n-1) (as for example at n=11).
