%N A378640 Smallest m such that phi(m) does not divide n, where phi is the Euler totient function (A000010).
%C A378640 Up to n = 10^7 the distinct terms of the sequence (which are also the record values) are {3, 5, 7, 11, 15, 17, 19, 23, 29, 47, 51, 53}. Is this A076245 (for n >= 2)?
%C A378640 First differs from A095366 at n = 60.
%C A378640 It appears that a(n) = A095366(n) except when n = 60*(2*k + 1), with k >= 0, where a(n) = 15 while A095366(n) = 17.
