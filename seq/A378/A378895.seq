%N A378895 a(n) is n times the number of missing distinct digits, k, of the terms of the sequence so far, counted from start and thereafter from every term that immediately follows any term with a value of 0.
%C A378895 By definition, no two terms with the value of 0 can be next to each other, because all terms immediately following a term of 0 value invariably equal to 10*n.
%C A378895 Beyond sufficiently large n's, 0 value terms will become increasingly frequent, and with expected probability, they will tend to occur at some runs as every second term. Yet, this is not a certainty since large n's exist with a single or just a few distinct digits. More to the point, the products of n's and the number of missing distinct digits of the terms in the relevant sections of the sequence may not necessarily always yield immediately new distinct digits for the count.
%e A378895 a(1) = 10 because k = 10 distinct digits, namely 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9, are missing from the terms of the sequence before n = 1, and this number multiplied by n = 1 is 10.
%e A378895 a(2) = 16 because k = 8 distinct digits are missing from the terms so far in the sequence as a(1) containing two distinct digits, 0 and 1, out of the possible ten; so 8 multiplied by n = 2 results in 16.
%e A378895 a(54) = 0 because the terms a(41)...a(53) contain all the ten distinct digits, the digit 3 in a(53) = 53 completing finally the set, and so the number of missing distinct digits k is 0, and 0 times 54 being 0 as a result.
%e A378895 a(55) = 550 since new count of the missing distinct digits of terms starts following a(54) = 0, and that count is k = 10, and therefore 55 times 10 is 550.
