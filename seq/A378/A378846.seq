%N A378846 Smallest starting x which takes n halving steps to reach the minimum of a cycle in the 3x-1 iteration.
%C A378846 Each step is x -> 3x-1 if x odd, or x -> x/2 if x even (A001281) and here only the halving steps x/2 are counted.
%C A378846 The number of halving steps is A377524(x) so that a(n) = x is the smallest x for which A377524(x) = n.
%C A378846 a(n) <= 2*a(n-1) is an upper bound since x = 2*a(n-1) is a candidate for a(n) by first step x -> x/2.
%C A378846 All even terms are a(n) = 2*a(n-1), since any smaller even a(n) would imply a smaller a(n-1) by first step x -> x/2.
%C A378846 No term is of the form y = 6*k + 2, apart from a(1)=2, since odd x = 2*k+1 takes a tripling step to 3*x-1 = y and x is a smaller start with the same number of halvings as y.
