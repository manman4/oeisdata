%N A378726 The total number of fires on a rooted undirected infinite ternary tree with a self-loop at the root, when the chip-firing process starts with 3n chips at the root.
%C A378726 Each vertex of this tree has degree 4. If a vertex has at least 4 chips, the vertex fires and one chip is sent to each neighbor. The root sends 1 chip to its three children and one chip to itself.
%C A378726 The order of the firings doesn't affect the number of firings.
%C A378726 The corresponding sequence for a binary tree is in A376131.
%C A378726 The corresponding sequence for a ternary tree is in A378724.

%e A378726 Suppose we start with 12 chips at the root. Then the root will fire 3 times, 12 chips in total, 3 of which return to the root. The stable configuration will have 3 chips at the root and every child of the root. Thus, a(4) = 3.
%e A378726 Suppose we start with 15 chips at the root. Then the root will fire 3 times, sending away 9 chips. After that, the root can fire again, sending away 3 chips and keeping 3 chips. Now, each child of the root has four chips, and they can also fire. Firing them returns 3 chips to the root. Thus, the root can fire one more time. The stable configuration will have 3 chips at the root and 1 chip at each child and grandchild. The root fires 5 times, and each child fires three times. Thus, a(5) = 8.
