%N A378758 Number of 1's required to build n using +, -, and ^.
%C A378758 All intermediate steps in building the number should be integers as well, for consistency with related sequences.
%C A378758 A348262(n) >= a(n) >= A091334(n) for all n, as the available operators in A348262 are a subset of the available operators here, and the available operators here are a subset of the available operators in A091334.

%e A378758 a(22) = 10 because 22 = (1+1+1+1+1)^(1+1)-(1+1+1), which has 10 occurrences of the symbol "1", and there is no way of making 22 with fewer using these rules.
%e A378758 Note that A348262(22) = 12 because 22 = (1+1)^(1+1)^(1+1)+(1+1)^(1+1)+1+1; subtraction allows for two fewer occurrences of the symbol "1" to be used here. Similarly, A091334(22) = 9 because 22 = ((1+1+1)^(1+1)+1+1)*(1+1); multiplication allows for one fewer occurrence of the symbol "1" to be used there. 22 is the least n such that A348262(n) > a(n) > A091334(n).
