%N A378674 Triangle T(n,k) read by rows, where row n is a permutation of numbers 1 through n, such that if the deck of n cards is prepared in this order, and down-under dealing is used, then the resulting cards are put down in increasing order.
%C A378674 Down-under dealing is a dealing pattern where the top card is dealt then the next card is put on the bottom of the deck. Then, this pattern repeats until all cards are dealt.
%C A378674 This card dealing is related to a variation of the Josephus problem, where the first person is eliminated and the second person is skipped. The card in row n and column k is x if and only if in the Josephus problem variation with n people, the person number x is the k-th person eliminated. Equivalently, each row of the Josephus triangle A378682 related to this variation is an inverse permutation of the corresponding row of this triangle.
%C A378674 The total number of moves for row n is 2n-1.
%C A378674 The first column is the order of elimination of the first person in the corresponding variation of the Josephus problem and consists of all ones.
%C A378674 The index of the largest number in row n is A152423(n), corresponding to the index of the freed person in this variation of the Josephus problem.
%C A378674 T(n,2j-1) = j, for 2j-1 <= n.
%C A378674 Sequence A378635 represents a similar triangle for under-down dealing.

%F A378674 T(1,1) = 1, for n > 1, T(n,1) = 1 and T(n,2) = T(n-1,n-1) + 1. For n > 1 and k > 2, T(n,k) = T(n-1,k-2) + 1.

%F A378674 T(n,k) = A378635(n-1,k-1) + 1 for 2 <= k <= n.
%F A378674 T(n,k) = A378635(n,(k mod n) + 1).

%e A378674 Suppose there are four cards arranged in order 1,3,2,4. Card 1 is dealt, and card 3 goes under, then card 2 is dealt, and card 4 goes under. Now, the leftover deck is ordered 3,4. Card 3 is dealt, and card 4 goes under. Now, the leftover deck is card 4, which is dealt. The dealt cards are in order. Thus, the fourth row of the triangle is 1,3,2,4.
