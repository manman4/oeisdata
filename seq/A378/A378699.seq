%N A378699 Number of proper prime powers between powerful numbers that are not prime powers.
%C A378699 Within the sequence S = A001694 of powerful numbers, we have either proper prime powers k (in A246547) and numbers m that are not prime powers (in A286708). This sequence is the number of k between m.

%e A378699 We partition S = A001694 by numbers m in A286708 (in brackets) and derive the following irregular table:
