%N A378885 Numbers that are divisible by at least three different primes and the smallest three of them are consecutive primes.
%C A378885 All the positive multiples of 30 (A249674 \ {0}) are terms.
%C A378885 Numbers k such that A151800(A020639(k)) | k and also A101300(A020639(k)) | k.

%e A378885 60 = 2^2 * 3 * 5 is a term since 2, 3 and 5 are consecutive primes.
%e A378885 770 = 2 * 5 * 7 * 11 is not a term since its smallest prime divisor is 2 and it is not divisible by 3, the prime next to 2.
%e A378885 1365 = 3 * 5 * 7 * 13 is a term since 3, 5 and 7 are consecutive primes.
