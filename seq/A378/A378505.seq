%C A378505 There are an infinite number of zeros in the sequence. If not, suppose a(m) was the last one. Then for j > m, we would have a(j-1) = (m+1) + (m+2) + ... + (j-1) = (j+m)*(j-m-1)/2. In particular, a(m*(m+1)-1) = (m-1)*m*(m+1)*(m+2)/2, which is divisible by m*(m+1) since m-1 or m+2 is even, and that would mean a(m*(m+1)) = 0, contradiction. (End)

%C A378505 For some z_0 > 0 such that a(z_0) = 0 we can find the next z_1 > z_0 such that a(z_1) = 0 but for any z_0 < t < z_1 we have a(t) > 0. Then a(t) = binomial(t+1, 2) - binomial(z0+1, 2). Since a(z_1) = 0 we have z_1 | (binomial(z_1 -1 +1, 2) - binomial(z0+1, 2)) = z_1 * (z_1 - 1) / 2 - z_0 * (z_0 + 1)/2.
%C A378505 This means z_1 | 2*(z_1 * (z_1 - 1) / 2 - z_0 * (z_0 + 1)/2) = (z_1 * (z_1 - 1) - z_0 * (z_0 + 1)) where (z_1 * (z_1 - 1) - z_0 * (z_0 + 1)) > 0. As z_1 | z_1 * (z_1 - 1) we also have z_1 | (z_0 * (z_0 + 1)). By the proof of _Robert Israel_ above such z_1 must exist. (End)

%e A378505 a(11) = 49 + 11 = 60, since a(10) = 49, which does not exactly divide by 11.
%e A378505 a(12) = 0, since a(11) = 60, a nonzero number that exactly divides by 12.
%e A378505 a(13) = 0 + 13 = 13, since a(12) = 0 (so is not nonzero).
%e A378505 From _David A. Corneth_, Nov 30 2024: (Start)
%e A378505 The next 0 after n = 12 is a divisor of 12 * (12 + 1) = 156. The divisors of 156 that are larger than 12 + 1 = 13 are 26, 39, 52, 78, 156. Of these, 39 is the smallest z_1 such that z_1 | z_1 * (z_1 - 1) / 2 - z_0 * (z_0 + 1)/2. Therefore the next 0 after n = 12 is at n = 39.
%e A378505 The first few zeros are at 0, 3, 12, 39, 65, 78, 158, 237, ... (= A379013). As 100 is between the consecutive zeros 78 and 158 there is no zero strictly between 78 and 158 and so a(100) = 100*(100+1) / 2 - 78*(78+1)/2 = 1969. (End)
