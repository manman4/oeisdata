%N A378857 a(n) is the smallest k > 1 such that n^k starts and ends with n, or -1 if there is no such k.
%C A378857 Given an integer n such that a(n) != -1, it follows that n^A051248(n) starts with n and n^A074250(n) ends with n, and both are the smallest exponents that satisfy these conditions. In this case, n^a(n) starts and ends with n. Due to this condition, larger exponents are required. For example, for n = 21 the smallest exponent satisfying the condition is 12086.
%F A378857 a(n) >= max{A074250(n), A051248(n)} except that a(n) = -1 when A074250(n) = -1.
%e A378857 2^21 = 2097152 is the smallest power of 2 that starts and ends with 2, so a(2) = 21.
