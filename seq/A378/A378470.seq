%N A378470 a(n) is the smallest number k for which the width pattern of the symmetric representation of sigma(k), SRS(k), consists of two unimodal parts of maximum width n.
%C A378470 Let the nonincreasing multiset cL = { c_1, ... , c_s } be a factorization of n, let dL = { d_1, ... , d_s } be any set of s distinct odd primes, let q = dL^(cL - 1) = d_1^(c_1 - 1) * ... * d_s^(c_s - 1), and let k satisfy 2^k < q < 2^(k+1). Then SRS(2^k * q) is unimodal of maximum height n, 2^k * q has 2n odd divisors and its width pattern has 2n-1 entries. The smallest possible choice for 2^k * q is with the increasing sequence of odd primes d_i = p_(i+1), 1 <= i <= s. The overall smallest 2^k * q is the minimum among all factorizations of n. The smallest number m for which SRS(m) has two unimodal parts of maximum width n requires the additional prime factor r > 2^(k+1) * q which yields m = 2^k * q * r.
%C A378470 This sequence is column 2 in the array of A367377 and a(2) = A370206(1).
%F A378470 a(p) = 2^k * 3^(p-1) * r, for odd primes p, with 2^k < 3^(p-1) < 2^(k+1) and r > 2^(k+1) * 3^(p-1) least prime, i.e., k = floor( (p-1)*(log_2 (3)) ) and r = prime( primepi(2^(k+1) * 3^(p-1)) + 1 ).
%e A378470 a(2) = 78  is in the sequence since SRS(78) consists of two parts with width pattern 1 2 1 0 1 2 1 and 78 is the smallest number with those properties.
%e A378470 a(3) = 10728 = 2^3 * 3^2 * 149 is in the sequence since SRS(10728) consists of two parts with width pattern 1 2 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 2 1 and 10728 is the smallest number with those properties.
%e A378470 a(6) = 4157280 = 2^5 * 3^2 * 5 * 2887 is in the sequence. The two factorizations of 6 are {6} and {3, 2} so that with 3^5 = 243 and 3^2 * 5^1 = 45 the inequality 2^5 < 45 < 2^6 determines the single unimodular SRS(32 * 45) of maximum width 6, A250071(6) = 1440. Since 2887 is the smallest prime exceeding 2^6 * 3^2 * 5, 4157280 is the smallest number with SRS(4157280) consisting of two unimodular parts of maximum width 6.
