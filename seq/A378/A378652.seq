%F A378652 {k such that A083206(k) = 2}.
%e A378652 Divisors of 40 are [1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 40], whose sum is 90. These can be partitioned in two ways so that both the set and its complement has sum 45, either as 40+5 = 1+2+4+8+10+20 or as 40+4+1 = 2+5+8+10+20, therefore 40 is included in this sequence.
