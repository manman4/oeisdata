%N A380478 Nonprime numbers k such that A380459(k) has no divisors of form p^p.
%C A380478 See A380468 to find why each term must be squarefree.
%C A380478 After the initial 1 all terms here are even (thus in A039956) because as A276086(k) flips the parity of k, having more than one odd prime factor in k without a single 2 would make A380459(k) a multiple of 4, and thus outside of A048103.
%C A380478 For a similar reason, any term that is not a multiple of 3 may have at most 3 prime factors.
