%N A380468 Numbers k such that A380459(k) has no divisors of the form p^p, for any prime p.
%C A380468 Proof that this is a subsequence of squarefree numbers (A005117): Let's write A380459(n) = Product_{d|n} A276086(n/d)^A349394(d). Then suppose that we have a prime p such that p^e || n, with e > 1 (the maximal exponent e for which p^e divides n). We set d = p^e, and for that d, factor A276086(n/(p^e))^A349394(p^e) = A276086(n/(p^e))^(p^(e-1)) is contributed to the product A380459(n). But n/(p^e) is not divisible by p, so A020639(A276086(n/(p^e))) <= p as either p or some lesser prime q < p is the first prime missing from the factorization of n/(p^e) [see comments in A276086], so in the former case there will be a factor p^(p^(e-1)) [thus also p^p], and in the latter case a factor q^(p^(e-1)) [thus also q^q as p^(e-1) > q] present in the product, so in any such case the product will not be in A048103, and therefore each term must be squarefree.
%C A380468 The least terms k for which A001222(k) = 0, 1, 2, ..., are given in A380475.
