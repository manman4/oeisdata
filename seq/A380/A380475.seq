%N A380475 a(n) is the least term in A380468 that has exactly n prime factors.
%C A380475 If it exists, a(5) > 2^35. - _Antti Karttunen_, Feb 19 2025
%C A380475 Conjecture: Sequence is finite and a(4) is the last term. This is equivalent to the claim that no arithmetic derivative (A003415) of a product of five or more distinct primes, (i.e., the value of the (n-1)-st elementary symmetric polynomial formed from those n distinct primes) can be formed as a carry-free sum of those n summands in primorial base (A049345). See also A380476 and A380528, A380530.

%F A380475 a(n) = Min_{k in A380468} for which A001221(k) = n.
%e A380475 186 = 2*3*31 and A276086(186/2) = 2058 = 2 * 3 * 7^3, A276086(186/3) = 3 * 7^2, A276086(186/31) = 5, whose product =  2^1 * 3^2 * 5^1 * 7^5 = 1512630 = A380459(186), and as all the exponents are less than the corresponding primes, the product is in A048103, and because there are no any smaller number with three prime factors satisfying the same condition (of A380468), 186 is the term a(3) of this sequence. Note that A049345(A003415(186)) = 5121, where the digits are the exponents in the product read from the largest to the smallest prime factor.
