%N A380508 Lexicographically earliest sequence of positive integers such that for any n, consecutive occurrences of n are separated by a(n) distinct terms and each subsequence enclosed by consecutive equal values is distinct.
%C A380508 Endpoints are excluded when counting the number of distinct terms enclosed.
%C A380508 Endpoints are included when comparing subsequences enclosed.

%e A380508 a(2) = 2, so 2's enclose 2 distinct terms. For example: a(2..6) = 2,1,3,1,2 enclosing the two distinct values in 1,3,1.
%e A380508 a(3) = 1, so 3's enclose 1 distinct term. In this case, there are no subsequences enclosed by a pair of 3s.
%e A380508 a(7) = 4: a(7) cannot be 1 as this would repeat the subsequence [1,2,1], which was seen before at a(1..3). 2 and 3 would not enclose a(2) = 2 and a(3) = 1 distinct terms respectively. So a(7) = 4, which has not occurred thus far.
