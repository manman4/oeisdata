%N A380188 a(n) is the maximum number of coincidences of the first n terms of this sequence and a cyclic shift of the first n terms of A380189, i.e., the number of equalities a(k) = A380189((s+k) mod n) for 0 <= k < n, maximized over s.
%C A380188 Is a(n+1)-a(n) always 0 or 1?
%C A380188 Consider a pair of sequences b and c defined in the following manner:
%C A380188   - b(n) is the number of coincidences of the first n terms of sequences b and c,
%C A380188   - c(n) is the number of coincidences of the first n terms of sequence b and the first n terms of sequence c in reverse order.
%C A380188 (The sequences are "self-starting" with no initial values required, because for n = 0 there are obviously no coincidences, so b(0) = c(0) = 0.) For each of b and c, we may or may not allow circular shifts and maximize the number of coincidences over all such shifts, so there are four versions:
%C A380188   - No shifts: (b,c) = (A379265,A379266).
%C A380188   - Shifts in b but not in c: (b,c) = (A380188,A380189).
%C A380188   - Shifts in c and either shifts or no shifts in b: In both these cases, b and c are the following sequences, which are constant from n = 5 and n = 7, respectively:
%C A380188       b: 0, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, ...
%C A380188       c: 0, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, ...

%e A380188 The first time the shift comes into play is for n = 21. The first 21 terms of this sequence and of A380189 are:
%e A380188   0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4
%e A380188   0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 3, 1, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3
%e A380188   ^  ^     ^                    ^
%e A380188 with only 4 coincidences. But if the second row is shifted 7 steps to the right, we get:
%e A380188   0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4
%e A380188   0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 3, 1, 0, 2
%e A380188   ^     ^  ^     ^  ^
%e A380188 with 5 coincidences. This is the best possible, so a(21) = 5.
