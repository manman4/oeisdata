%N A380461 Number of edge covers of fan graph F_{2,n}.
%C A380461 The fan graph F_{2,n} is the join of the path graph P_n with two isolated vertices. That is, two new vertices are added and each is connected to every vertex in P_n. a(n) is the number of edge covers of F_{2,n}.

%F A380461 a(n) = 11*a(n-1) - 24*a(n-2) - 21*a(n-3) + 33*a(n-4) + 34*a(n-5) + 8*a(n-6),  for n >= 7.
%e A380461 For n = 1, the fan graph F_{2,1} becomes a path with three vertices. There is exactly 1 edge cover.
%e A380461 For n = 2, the base graph P_2 has endpoints v and w, and two added vertices a and b each connect to both v and w. Each of a and b has 3 edge-covering options: use the edge to v, the edge to w, or both. This gives 3 Ã— 3 = 9 combinations. For each, the edge (v,w) from P_2 may be included or not, giving 18 configurations. However, in 2 of these, omitting the edge (v,w) leaves v or w uncovered. Therefore, the number of valid edge covers is 18 - 2 = 16.
