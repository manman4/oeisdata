%N A380597 Smallest side length of a square board on which Harary's generalized tic-tac-toe (or animal tic-tac-toe) for the free polyomino with binary code A246521(n+1) is a first-player win, or 0 if it is a draw for all board sizes.
%C A380597 The only unknown value is a(45), corresponding to the "long N" hexomino. It has been suggested that a(45) = 15 and A380598(45) = 13.
%C A380597 Can be read as an irregular triangle, whose n-th row contains A000105(n) terms, n >= 1.
%C A380597 The number of free polyominoes of size k = 1, 2, ... for which the game is a first-player win is 1, 1, 2, 4, 3, x, 0, 0, ..., where x is 0 or 1 and all terms after x are 0.

%e A380597 For n = 9, the polyomino with binary code A246521(9+1) = 75 is the straight tetromino. Generalized tic-tac-toe for this polyomino (i.e., 4 cells in a row, horizontally or vertically, are needed to win) is a draw for square boards of side length less than 7, but on a 7 X 7 board the first player can force a win in at most 8 moves, so a(9) = 7.
