%N A380139 Prime gaps between 10^m and 10^(m+1), m>=0, sorted first by falling number of occurrences and then by rising gap size, written as an irregular triangle.
%C A380139 A gap between two primes p1 and p2 is assumed to belong to the range [10^m .. 10^(m+1)[ if 10^m <= (p1+p2)/2 < 10^(m+1). Thus the gap between 7 and 11 is counted in the interval 1 .. 10. Gaps symmetric to 10^k occur for k = 17, 45, ... .
