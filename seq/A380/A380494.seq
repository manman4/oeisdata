%N A380494 a(1) = 1. For n > 1 a(n) is the smallest positive integer not yet in the sequence which is divisible by A007953(a(n-1)) + 1.
%C A380494 For n > 1 a(n) is the smallest novel multiple of digsum(a(n-1)) + 1. The "+1" is intended to avoid an infinite number of consecutive multiples of 9, which would otherwise occur after a(13). The only way a(n) = prime p can occur is if A007953(a(n-1)) is the first occasion of p-1. Sequence is conjectured to be a permutation of the natural numbers, with primes in order.

%e A380494 a(1) = 1 has digsum = 1, therefore a(2) = 2, the smallest novel multiple of 1+1 = 2.
%e A380494 Likewise, a(n) = n for all n <= 10. a(11) = 12 because 1 + digsum(10) = 2 and 12 is the smallest number not already a term which is divisible by 2.
%e A380494 a(20) = 28, and digsum(28) + 1 = 11. Therefore a(21) = 11 because 28 is the first occasion of digsum(a(n-1)) = 10.
