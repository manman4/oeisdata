%N A380442 a(n) is the largest Frobenius number of three distinct relatively prime numbers that sum to n.
%C A380442 6 is the smallest number that can be partitioned into three distinct positive integers excluding n = 1 through 5.
%C A380442 a(6) would be -1 as the only partition of 6 into 3 distinct numbers that are relatively prime are (1, 2, 3) and the largest Frobenius number of that partition is -1.
%C A380442 Similarly a(7) and a(8) would be -1 as all partitions of these numbers into three distinct parts have a 1 in them.

%e A380442 a(11) = 3 as the partitions of 11 into 3 distinct numbers that are relatively prime are (2,4,5) and (2,3,6) that have Frobenius number 3 and 1 respectively and their maximum is 3.
