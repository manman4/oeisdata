%N A380695 Numbers k such that the prime index of the least prime dividing k is larger than or equal to the maximum exponent in the prime factorization of k; a(1) = 1 by convention.
%C A380695 First differs from A368110 at n = 68: A368110(68) = 98 is not a term of this sequence.
%C A380695 Subsequence of A380692 and first differs from it at n = 428: A380692(428) = 625 is not a term of this sequence.
%C A380695 Numbers k such that A055396(k) >= A051903(k).
%C A380695 Disjoint union of the sequences S_k, k >= 1, where S_k is the sequence of p-rough numbers (numbers whose prime factors are all greater than or equal to p), with p = prime(k), whose maximum exponent in their prime factorization is k (i.e., numbers that are (k+1)-free but not k-free, where k-free numbers are numbers whose prime factorization exponents do not exceed k).
%C A380695 The asymptotic density of this sequence is Sum_{i>=1} d(i) = 0.68165919742420048618..., where d(i), the density of S_i, equals f(i+1) * Product_{primes p < prime(i)} ((1-1/p)/(1-1/p^(i+1))) - f(i) * Product_{primes p < prime(i)} ((1-1/p)/(1-1/p^i)), f(i) = 1/zeta(i) if i >= 2, and f(1) = 0.

%e A380695 2 = 2^1 is a term since PrimePi(2) = 1 >= 1.
%e A380695 4 = 2^2 is not a term since PrimePi(2) = 1 is smaller than the exponent 2.
%e A380695 25 = 5^2 is a term since PrimePi(5) = 3 >= 2.
