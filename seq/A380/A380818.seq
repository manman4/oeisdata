%N A380818 Numbers k such that the Diophantine equation d_r*x^r + ... + d_0*x^0 = 0 has an integer solution. k = (d_r .. d_0) in decimal notation, d_i are the digits of k.
%C A380818 For r >= 1, d_r >= 1, numbers k = d_r*10^r are terms. It looks like the solution x (if it exists) is from [-9, 0].
%e A380818 k = 68: the Diophantine equation 6*x + 8 = 0 has no integer solution, thus k = 68 is not a term.
%e A380818 k = 132: the Diophantine equation 1*x^2 + 3*x + 2 = 0 has integer solutions x = -1, x = -2, thus k = 132 is a term.
%Y A380818 Cf. A037124 (for k >= 10).
