%N A380868 Number of distinct solutions {n1, n2, n3, n4} to the problem of forming a rectangle with sides made of linked rods of length 1, ..., n.
%C A380868 A solution to the problem is given by n1 > n2 > n3 > n4 >= 0 such that T(n) = 2*(A+B) with side lengths A = T(n1) - T(n2) = T(n3) - T(n4) and B = T(n2) - T(n3), where T = A000217.
%C A380868 When n4 = 0, this means that the rods of length 1 and n meet in a corner. When there are two consecutive n_k's (e.g. n1 = 7, n2 = 6 for n = 8) this means that one side is made of one single rod, of length equal to the larger of the two n_k's.
%C A380868 Nonzero terms are at indices listed in A380867.
%C A380868 From _Daniel Mondot_, Mar 17 2025: (Start)
%C A380868 Conjecture 1: All terms are triangular numbers.
%C A380868 Conjecture 2: All triangular numbers will eventually appear in this sequence. (End)
%C A380868 From _Daniel Mondot_, Oct 19 2025: (Start)
%C A380868 Proof of conjecture 1 from "PentaPig" with a minor correction from "frogkabobs" (see Reddit link below): (quote)
%C A380868 Yes, in fact this holds for any choice for the lengths of the rods.
%C A380868 Lemma: Consider a circle with n marked points on the boundary. Then the number of rectangles with all corners on marked points is a triangle number.
%C A380868 Proof: Both diagonals of such a rectangle consist of two antipodal points. Conversely any two pairs of antipodal points yield a rectangle. Then the number of rectangles is T(k-1) where k is the number of antipodal pairs.
%C A380868 This can be applied to your case by deforming the linked rods into a circle. That is a take a circle with circumference T(n) and split its boundary into segments of length 1,2,3,etc. Any rectangle within this circle can be turned into a solution to your problem by taking the arcs above the sides of the rectangle (and vice versa).
