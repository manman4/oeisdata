%N A380277 A version of the array A229607 without duplicates, read by antidiagonals: each row starts with the least prime not in a previous row, and each number p in a row is followed by the greatest prime q in the interval p < q < 2*p not in a previous row (or 0 if no such q exists).
%C A380277 It appears that the first column is A104272.
%C A380277 Proof: (This proof assumes that all terms of the array are nonzero. It would be nice to see a proof of this.) Let n >= 2 and p = T(n,1). To prove that p = A104272(n) we need to prove that pi(x)-pi(x/2) >= n for x >= p and that pi(p-1)-pi((p-1)/2) < n. Let x >= p and let q be the smallest prime larger than x. In each of the rows 1..n there are consecutive terms r < r' with r < q <= r' < 2*r, so q/2 < r < q. Hence there are at least n primes between q/2 and q (not counting q itself), i.e., pi(q)-pi(q/2) >= n+1. It follows that pi(x)-pi(x/2) = pi(q)-1-pi(x/2) >= pi(q)-1-pi(q/2) >= n. Finally, if pi(p-1)-pi((p-1)/2) >= n there would exist two consecutive terms r and r' in one of the rows 1..(n-1) with (p-1)/2 < r < r' <= p-1. This is impossible, because then p (or some larger prime) would have been chosen instead of r' as the successor of r. Hence pi(p-1)-pi((p-1)/2) < n. This concludes the proof (with the caveat above).

%e A380277 The least prime not in any of the first 6 rows is T(7,1) = 59. The greatest prime less than 2*59 = 118 is 113, but that number appears in a previous row as T(3,4). The next smaller prime is 109, which does not appear in a previous row, so T(7,2) = 109.
