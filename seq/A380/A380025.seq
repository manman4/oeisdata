%N A380025 Area of smallest rectangle of grid cells such that it is possible to mark a connected subset of the cells so that the lengths of runs of marked cells have lengths from 2 to n, each length appearing exactly once.
%C A380025 Runs may be horizontal or vertical and only lengths > 1 are considered.
%C A380025 In the puzzle, the best solutions are the ones with the most free space (fewest marked cells). In this sequence, only the area of the smallest rectangle is considered.
