%N A380507 Lexicographically earliest infinite sequence of positive integers such that for any n, consecutive occurrences of n are separated by a(n) terms and each subsequence enclosed by consecutive equal values is distinct.
%C A380507 Endpoints are included when comparing subsequences enclosed by consecutive equal values.

%e A380507 a(1) = 1 means that consecutive 1s enclose 1 term. For example: a(1..3) = [1,2,1] encloses [2].
%e A380507 a(2) = 2 means that consecutive 2s have length 2. In this case, there are no subsequences enclosed by a pair of 2s.
%e A380507 a(3) = 1 means that consecutive 3s enclose 1 term. For example, a(3..5) = [3,1,3] encloses [1].
%e A380507 a(7) = 4: a(7) cannot be 1 as this would repeat the subsequence [1,3,1], which was seen before at a(3..5). 2 and 3 would not enclose a(2) = 2 and a(3) = 1 terms respectively. So a(7) = 4, which has not occurred thus far.
