%N A380196 Orders of Origami monoid on n strings constructed from the Jones monoid on n strings.
%C A380196 This sequence was obtained from GAP computations of the cardinalities of Origami monoids constructed using the free product of the Jones monoid with itself mod additional relations motivated by DNA Origami diagrams. Where the generators of the Jones monoid are h_1, h_2, ..., h_{n-1}, we have the generators of the Origami monoid are a_1, ..., a_{n-1}, b_1, ..., b_{n-1}. The additional relations are produced by substituting a_ib_i and b_ia_i into every instance of h_i in the original relations of the Jones monoid, along with the relations a_ib_j=b_ja_i for all i,j such that i and j are not equal and are between 1 and n-1. The order for the Jones monoid on n strings is given by the n-th Catalan number (A000108).
%C A380196 The Origami monoid constructed from the Jones monoid on n strings is finite for all n.
