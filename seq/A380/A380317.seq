%N A380317 The lexicographically earliest sequence of positive numbers which is identical to the run lengths of its first differences.
%C A380317 34 is the smallest value that does not appear in the first 10000 terms.
%C A380317 Conjecture: Every positive integer eventually appears.
%C A380317 Shortly after submitting this sequence the author, _Dominic McCarty_, discovered that it is almost identical to A281579: in fact, a(n) = A281579(n) - 1 for all n. However, since A281579 has seniority and the present sequence has a simpler definition and is more likely to be searched for, it has been decided to retain both entries. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Feb 17 2025
%C A380317 The index of n in the present sequence is given by A281900(n+1).

%e A380317 The sequence of first differences (where the n-th term is a(n+1)-a(n)) is:
%e A380317 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, -1, -1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1, -1, -1, 0, 0, ...

%e A380317 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, ...
%e A380317 Which is the original sequence.
