%N A380671 a(n) is the smallest number not yet in the sequence which is coprime to n and shares at least one decimal digit with n.
%C A380671 Like A065190 but with the extra condition that n and a(n) must have at least one decimal digit in common. Definition implies that a(1) = 1 is the only fixed point. Let a(n) be even then 2|a(n) -> 2!|n-> 2|(n+1)->2!|a(n+1), therefore there are no consecutive even terms. Let [n] = |n - a(n)|, then it follows from the coprime conditions of the definition that n, a(n), [n] are pairwise coprime. Sequence is conjectured to be a permutation of the natural numbers with [n] < 100 (= base^2).

%F A380671 a(a(n)) = n for all n (sequence is self inverse).
%e A380671 a(1) = 1 since 1 is the smallest novel number prime to 1 and sharing a digit with it so a(2) = 21 because digit 2 is shared, Gcd(2,21) = 1 and there is no smaller number with this property. a(7) = 17 implies a(17) = 7 (self inverse property).
