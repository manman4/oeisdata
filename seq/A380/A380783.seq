%N A380783 Lexicographically earliest sequence of positive integers such that for any value k, no two sets of one or more indices at which k occurs have the same product.
%C A380783 The Fermi-Dirac primes (A050376) are the indices of 2s in this sequence.

%e A380783 a(8) = 3: We cannot have 1 here because the set of indices i = 8 and i = 1,8 would have the same product. We cannot have a(8) = 2 because i = 8 would have the same product as i = 2,4. So a(8) = 3.
