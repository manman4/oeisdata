%N A380166 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of sequences in which the games of a fully symmetric single-elimination tournament with 2^n teams can be played if arbitrarily many arenas are available and the number of distinct times at which games are played is k, 1 <= k <= 2^n-1.
%C A380166 T(n,k) is also the number of tie-permitting labeled histories for a fully symmetric labeled topology with 2^n leaves and exactly k times at which events take place.

%F A380166 T(1,1) = 1 and for n > 1 and n <= k <= 2^n - 1, T(n,k) = Sum_{c=max(n-1,k-2^(n-1))..min(2^(n-1)-1,k-1)} Sum_{d=max(n-1,k-c-1)..min(2^(n-1)-1,k-1)} ((k-1)! / ((k-1-d)! * (k-1-c)! * (c+d-(k-1))!)) * T(n-1,c) * T(n-1,d).

%e A380166 For n = 2 and a tournament with 2^2 = 4 teams and structure ((A,B),(C,D)), game (A,B) can be played before or after game (C,D); the championship game occurs later, producing T(2,3) = 2. Alternatively, game (A,B) can be played simultaneously with (C,D), with the championship game occurring later, producing T(2,2) = 1.
