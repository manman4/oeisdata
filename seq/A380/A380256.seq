%N A380256 Number of rooted binary normal unlabeled galled trees with n leaves and exactly 1 gall.
%C A380256 The asymptotic growth of a(n) follows (0.3910...)(2.4833...^n)n^(1/2), where 2.4833... is the constant represented by A086317.

%F A380256 G.f.: 1/(1-U(x)) - 1/(1-U(x))^2 + U(x)/(2*(1-U(x))^3) + U(x)/(2*(1-U(x))*(1-U(x^2))), where U(x) is the g.f. of A001190 (eq. 48 of Agranat-Tamir et al., Bull. Math. Biol. 86 (2024), 45).
%e A380256 For n=3 leaves, there is a unique rooted binary unlabeled tree with a root gall from which 3 leaves are descended; hence a(3)=1. This galled tree has the shape:

%Y A380256 Radius of convergence of the generating function follows the contstant A240943 (exponential growth according to A086317).
