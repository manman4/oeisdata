%N A380107 a(1) = 0; for n >= 1, if there exists an m < n such that a(m) = a(n), take the largest such m and let a(n+1) be the number of distinct runs in the subsequence a(m)..a(n-1). Otherwise, a(n+1) = 0.
%C A380107 This is a variant of Van Eck's sequence A181391 in which we count distinct runs of consecutive equal values rather than individual terms.
%C A380107 The longest run in the sequence has length 2.

%e A380107 a(10)=4: We find that the most recent occurrence of a(n) = a(9) = 1 is a(3) = 1. In between a(3) and a(8), we find 4 distinct runs: [1]; [0]; [2]; [2,2]. So a(10)=4.
