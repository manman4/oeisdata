%N A380437 Integers with at least 1 proper factorization for which the sum of the squares of the factors is a square, whose square root is also a factor of that number.
%C A380437 This sequence includes all values b^(c^2) for each integer b >= 2 and c >= 2 where the prime factors of c are equal to or a subset of the prime factors of b. In these cases, c*b, which is the square root of the sum of c^2 squares of b, will always be a factor of b^(c^2). E.g. b=2 and c=2 (both with only {2} as their prime factor) gives 2^(2^2) = 16 (a(1)), which can be factored as {2, 2, 2, 2}, for which sqrt(2^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 + 2^2)=4, also a factor of 16.
%e A380437 a(1) = 16: {2, 2, 2, 2} (2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 16 and sqrt(2^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 + 2^2) = 4, which is also a factor of 16).
%e A380437 a(2) = 108: {3, 6, 6} (3 * 6 * 6 = 108 and sqrt(3^2 + 6^2 + 6^2) = 9, which is also a factor of 108).
%e A380437 a(3) = 192: {2, 2, 2, 4, 6} (2 * 2 * 2 * 4 * 6 = 192 and sqrt(2^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 + 4^2 + 6^2) = 8, which is also a factor of 192).
