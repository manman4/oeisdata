%N A380079 Start with a list of the positive integers L in increasing order. Then, at turn n>=1, element n jumps from its current position, m, to position m+n. Then a(n) = L(m+1).
%C A380079 It appears that a(n)=n+1 exactly when n belongs to A003622.  For all other positions, fill in the numbers 1,2,3,4, ... in increasing order. A proof should be possible using the theorem-prover Walnut, and is underway. - _Jeffrey Shallit_, Jan 12 2025
%C A380079 After infinitely many moves, the natural numbers are transformed back into their original order. This is because all numbers larger than n must jump over n, as they have a larger jump by definition. Therefore, n must return to its original place in the list. It appears that n returns to its place at A022342(n-1).
%C A380079 There seems to be an infinite number of ordered pairs of the form (k, k+1) such as (1,2), (4,5), (6,7), (9,10), (12,13), .. etc., and the first term in each pair is A003622.
%C A380079 Also, it seems that if we take the last number in the jump (i.e. L(m+n-1), we get natural numbers excluding the terms of A003622, which seems to be A022342.
%C A380079 The last appearance of k also seems to be A022342.
%C A380079 The graph has two "rays", one with slope ~ 1 on which lies about every third term, and one with slope 0.618 on which lie the other terms. - _M. F. Hasler_, May 09 2025

%F A380079 From _Jeffrey Shallit_, Jan 13 2025: (Start)
%F A380079 If n belongs to A003622, then a(n) = n+1.  Otherwise, a(A022342(n)) = n-1 for n >= 1. This can be proved with the Walnut theorem prover.
%F A380079 Alternatively, let g = (1+sqrt(5))/2, and let p be the fractional part of (n+1)*g. If p < 2-g, then a(n) = n+1. If p > 2-g, then a(n) = floor((n+1)/g). (End)
%e A380079 We start with 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10... First, 1 jumps over 2, so, a(1) = 2. In the second turn, 2 jumps over 1 and 3, so, a(2) =1. In the third turn, 3 jumps over 2,4, and 5, so a(3) = 2. And so on.
