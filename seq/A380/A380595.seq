%N A380595 a(n) is the first nonsquarefree number k such that the n consecutive nonsquarefree numbers starting with k are in arithmetic progression.
%C A380595 Since multiples of 4 are not squarefree, the common difference of the arithmetic progression will be 1, 2 or 4 in each case.
%C A380595 For an arithmetic progression of length 10 or more with initial term even and common difference 2 or 4, there would be an odd multiple of 9 between the first and last term.  Since multiples of 9 are not squarefree, these could not be consecutive nonsquarefree numbers.  Thus for n >= 10, the common difference must be 1, and a(n) = A045882(n).
%e A380595 a(2) = 4 because the 2 nonsquarefree numbers starting with 4 are 4, 6, forming an arithmetic progression with difference 2.
%e A380595 a(3) = 16 because the 3 nonsquarefree numbers starting with 16 are 16, 18, 20, forming an arithmetic progression with difference 2.
%e A380595 a(4) = a(5) = 28 because the 5 nonsquarefree numbers starting with 28 are 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, forming an arithmetic progression with difference 4.
%e A380595 a(6) = 5050 because the 6 nonsquarefree numbers starting with 5050 are 5050, 5052, 5054, 5056, 5058, 5060, forming an arithmetic progression with difference 2.
%e A380595 a(7) = 6348 because the 7 nonsquarefree numbers starting with 6348 are 6348, 6350, 6352, 6354, 6356, 6358, 6360, forming an arithmetic progression with difference 2.
%e A380595 a(8) = 144946, because the 8 nonsquarefree numbers starting with 144946 are 144946, 144948, 144950, 144952, 144954, 144956, 144958, 144960, forming an arithmetic progression with difference 2.
%e A380595 a(9) = 3348550, because the 9 nonsquarefree numbers starting with 3348550 are 3348550, 3348552, 3348554, 3348556, 3348558, 3348560, 3348562, 3348564, 3348566, forming an arithmetic progression with difference 2.
