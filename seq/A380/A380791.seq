%N A380791 For a positive rational x, let k(x) be the smallest positive integer such that all k >= k(x) have a partition into distinct parts with reciprocal sum equal to x. The n-th term in this sequence is equal to the number of x with k(x) equal to n.
%C A380791 R. L. Graham proved that every positive integer k >= 78 can be written as a sum a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_r of distinct positive integers, such that 1/a_1 + 1/a_2 + ... + 1/a_r is equal to 1. More generally, he showed that for every positive rational x there exists a k(x) such that all k >= k(x) can be written as a sum a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_r of distinct positive integers, such that 1/a_1 + 1/a_2 + ... + 1/a_r is equal to x.

%F A380791 a(n) = exp[n^(1/2 + o(1))].
%e A380791 a(66) = 2, as there are 2 positive rationals x (namely 4/5 and 11/12) such that 65 cannot be written as a sum of distinct positive integers whose reciprocal sum is equal to x, but every positive integer larger than or equal to 66 can be written in such a way.
%e A380791 As it turns out, for every positive rational x, there exists a positive integer k >= 65 such that k cannot be written as a sum of distinct positive integers with reciprocal sum equal to x. This is why a(n) = 0 for all n <= 65.
