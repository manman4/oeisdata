%N A380278 Lexicographically earliest infinite sequence of positive integers such that consecutive occurrences of k are separated by exactly k terms and each subsequence enclosed by consecutive equal values is distinct.
%C A380278 Does each value occur finitely many times?
%C A380278 Since the length of a subsequence is given by its enclosing values, the sequence remains the same whether we include those endpoints or not when checking the uniqueness of subsequences.

%e A380278 a(9) = 5: a(9) cannot be 1 because this would create the subsequence a(7..9) = 1,3,1 enclosing [3], which would repeat a(3..5) = 1,3,1 enclosing [3] again. a(9) cannot be 2 because this would not enclose 2 terms with the previous occurrence of 2. For the same reason, 3 and 4 do not work. a(9) can be the first occurrence of 5 without restriction. So a(9) = 5.
