%N A380298 Lexicographically earliest sequence of positive integers such that any value in the sequence, say v, appears at most twice, and in case v appears twice, then the decimal expansion of v appears in the concatenation of the values surrounded by the two occurrences of v.
%C A380298 Every positive integer appears twice in the present sequence:
%C A380298 - we can always extend the sequence with a value not yet in the sequence,
%C A380298 - for any n > 1, a(n) is at most one plus the greatest value so far,
%C A380298 - every integer appears at least once in the sequence (for any v > 0, v necessarily appears at least once among the 2*v-1 initial terms),
%C A380298 - for any v > 0, the first occurrence of v appears before the first occurrence of v+1,
%C A380298 - every integer appears twice in the sequence: for any v > 0, the value 10*v appears after the first occurrence of v, so eventually v must appear a second time.
