%N A380998 Largest k such that there are no two subsets of the k consecutive integers n..(n+k-1) with the same product.
%C A380998 For n >= 2, A239291(n) is the least k such that a(k) >= n. The reason that this does not hold for n = 1 is that the empty subset is not considered in A239291.

%F A380998 a(n) >= a(n-1)-1.
%e A380998 For n = 7, no two subsets of the 8 numbers 7..14 have the same product, but for the 9 numbers 7..15 the two subsets {8, 15} and {10, 12} have the same product (120), so a(7) = 8.
%e A380998 For n = 14, no two subsets of the 7 numbers 14..20 have the same product, but for the 8 numbers 14..21 the two subsets {14, 18, 20} and {15, 16, 21} have the same product (5040), so a(14) = 7.
