%N A380692 Numbers k such that the least prime dividing k is larger than the maximum exponent in the prime factorization of k; a(1) = 1 by convention.
%C A380692 First differs from A368110 at n = 68: A368110(68) = 98 is not a term of this sequence.
%C A380692 First differs from its subsequence A380695 at n = 428: a(428) = 625 is not a term of A380695.
%C A380692 Numbers k such that A020639(k) > A051903(k).
%C A380692 All the squarefree numbers (A005117) are terms, and all the odd terms of A067259 are terms of this sequence.
%C A380692 Disjoint union of the sequences S_k, k >= 1, where S_k is the sequence of p-rough numbers (numbers whose prime factors are all greater than or equal to p), with p = nextprime(k) = A151800(k), whose maximum exponent in their prime factorization is k (i.e., numbers that are (k+1)-free but not k-free, where k-free numbers are numbers whose prime factorization exponents do not exceed k).
%C A380692 The asymptotic density of this sequence is Sum_{i>=1} d(i) = 0.68213349032332767778..., where d(i), the density of S_i, equals f(i+1) * Product_{primes p <= i} ((1-1/p)/(1-1/p^(i+1))) - f(i) * Product_{primes p <= i} ((1-1/p)/(1-1/p^i)), f(i) = 1/zeta(i) if i >= 2, and f(1) = 0.
