%N A380356 a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, and for any n > 0, if a(n) is at square distance from the least integer (in absolute value) not yet in the sequence and of opposite sign to a(n), say u, then a(n+1) = u, otherwise a(n+1) = a(n) + sign(a(n)).
%C A380356 This sequence is a variant of A377091 that, by design, contains every integer (positive or negative).
%C A380356 Positive values appear in increasing order, negative values appear in decreasing order.

%e A380356 a(0) = 0 and a(1) = 1 by definition.
%e A380356 At this point, the least value (in absolute value) not yet in the sequence and of opposite sign is -1.
%e A380356 a(1) is not at square distance from -1, so a(2) = 1 + sign(1) = 2.
%e A380356 a(2) is not at square distance from -1, so a(3) = 2 + sign(2) = 3.
%e A380356 a(3) is at square distance from -1, so a(4) = -1.
%e A380356 At this point, the least value (in absolute value) not yet in the sequence and of opposite sign is 4.
%e A380356 a(4) is not at square distance from 4, so a(5) = -1 + sign(-1) = -2.
