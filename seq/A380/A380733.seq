%N A380733 Numbers k such that the prime index of the largest prime dividing k is smaller than or equal to the minimum exponent in the prime factorization of k; a(1) = 1 by convention.
%C A380733 Numbers k such that A061395(k) <= A051904(k).
%C A380733 Except for 2, all the terms are powerful (A001694).
%C A380733 Disjoint union of the sequences S_k, k >= 1, where S_k is the sequence of p-smooth numbers (numbers whose prime factors are all less than or equal to p), with p = prime(k), that are k-full but not (k+1)-full numbers (k-full numbers are numbers whose prime factorization exponents are all larger than or equal to k). S_1 contains only the term 2, and S_k is infinite for k >= 2. The sum of the reciprocals of the terms of S_k is rational for all k: 1/2, 31/72, 2657/14400, ... (see the Formula section).

%e A380733 4 = 2^2 is a term since PrimePi(2) = 1 <= 2.
%e A380733 25 = 5^2 is not a term since PrimePi(5) = 3 is larger than the exponent 2.
