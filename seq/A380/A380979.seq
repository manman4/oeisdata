%N A380979 Composites that cause a witness to be added to a set of Fermat witnesses: a(n) is the smallest composite number that is not guaranteed composite using Fermat's Little Theorem by the witness A380978(i) for any i < n.
%C A380979 A380978(n) is defined as the minimal Fermat witness that guarantees the compositeness of a(n). See the Weisstein link for details of the guarantee -- the option that uses a property derived from Fermat's little theorem.

%e A380979 a(1) = 4, since 4 is the smallest composite number and we need to add a witness to the empty set to guarantee its compositeness. 2 is the minimal Fermat witness for the compositeness of 4, so the set of witnesses becomes {2}.
%e A380979 a(2) = 341, since 341 is the smallest composite number that requires a witness other than 2, namely 3.
%e A380979 a(3) = 1105, since 1105 is the smallest composite number that requires a witness other than 2 and 3, namely 5.
