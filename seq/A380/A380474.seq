%N A380474 Numbers k such that A380459(k) has no divisors of the form p^p, while A003415(k) has such a divisor or is 0.
%C A380474 Because all terms k of A380468 are squarefree, they are also in A048103, so A003415(k) is outside of A048103 only if k is in A327934 or k = 1.
%C A380474 Like A380478, also this (after the initial 1) is a subsequence of A039956. The first three terms k with A001222(k) > 2 are: 11362082, 16782482, 20965982.
%C A380474 Contains 2*A141964 as a subsequence, because all primes p congruent to 25 mod 27 are also congruent to 1 mod 6, therefore A276086(p) is a nonmultiple of 3 in those cases and thus coprime with A276086(2) = 3.
%C A380474 In contrast, neither all 2*(primes congruent to 3123 mod 3125) nor all 2*(primes congruent to (7^7)-2 mod 7^7, like 1647082) are present. The missing ones are those for which A276086(p) is a multiple of 9, i.e., when p is in A047257.
