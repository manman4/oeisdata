%N A380579 Triangle read by rows in which row n lists n successive integers in descending order starting with the n-th positive integer not divisible by 3, with n >= 1 and 1 <= k <= n.
%C A380579 This sequence is mentioned in the Name section of A380580. That sequence represents a template for a Pop-Up pyramid which is related to Combinatorics, Geometry, Number Theory and several tens of integers sequences.
%C A380579 The n-th row of this triangle can be visualized in the template n - 1.
%C A380579 The sum of the n-th row equals the area of the largest polygon in the template n - 1.
%C A380579 In this triangle the last term of the row n is equal to both A237591(n-1,1) and A237593(n-1,1).
%C A380579 The m-th diagonal lists the terms of A008619 but starting from the term whose index is 3*m - 3, with m >= 1.
%C A380579 The column 3*m - 2 lists the terms of A001651 but starting from the m-th term, m >= 1.
%C A380579 The column 3*m - 1 lists the terms of A032766 but starting from the m-th term, m >= 1.
%C A380579 The column 3*m lists the terms of A007494 but starting from the m-th term, m >= 1.
%F A380579 T(n,k) = A001651(n) - k + 1.
%F A380579 G.f.: x*y*(1 + x - x^4*y^2 + x^2*(1 + y) - x^3*y*(1 + 2*y))/((1 - x)^2*(1 + x)*(1 - x*y)^2*(1 + x*y)). - _Stefano Spezia_, Apr 24 2025
