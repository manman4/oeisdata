%N A380146 Numbers that set records in A113901.
%C A380146 All terms in this sequence are numbers of least prime signature (A025487). Therefore it is easier to search for new terms in the product of A061394 (omega of least prime signature) and A036041 (bigomega of least prime signature). Similar to but ultimately different from A378630. Terms appear to be products of primorials (A002110) with powers of 2 (A000079), and thus are never divisible by the square of an odd prime.
%e A380146 omega(60) = 3 and bigomega(60) = 4; their product is 12. This product is larger than that for any smaller natural number, so 60 is a term of this sequence.
