%N A380377 Minimum number of total votes needed for one party to win if there are n voters divided into balanced districts, i.e., the numbers of voters in two districts may differ by at most 1.
%C A380377 The rules are the same as in A341721 (except that the number of voters in two districts may differ by 1 here): The winner must have a strict majority of the votes in a strictly larger number of districts than the other party has.
%C A380377 Empirically, it seems that the limit of (a(n)-n/4)/sqrt(n) exists with an approximate value of 0.3538.

%F A380377 a(n) <= A341721(n).
%F A380377 a(n) = a(n-1)+1 if n is in A380379, otherwise a(n) = a(n-1).
%F A380377 a(n) = A380378(n,A380381(n)) = A380378(n,A380382(n)).
%e A380377 For n = 9, a(9) = 4 votes are required to win. There can be either 3 districts 3+3+3 with 2 supporters in 2 of them, 6 districts 1+1+1+2+2+2 with 3 supporters in the single-voter districts and 1 in a 2-voter district, or 7 districts 1+1+1+1+1+2+2 with supporters in 4 of the single-voter districts.
%e A380377 For n = 17, a(17) = 6 votes are required to win. This can only be achieved with 5 districts 3+3+3+4+4 with 2 supporters in each of the 3 smaller districts.
