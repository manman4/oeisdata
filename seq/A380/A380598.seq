%N A380598 Number of moves required for the first player to win Harary's generalized tic-tac-toe (or animal tic-tac-toe) for the free polyomino with binary code A246521(n+1) on a square board of side length A380597(n), or 0 if it is a draw for all board sizes.
%C A380598 The only unknown value is a(45), corresponding to the "long N" hexomino. It has been suggested that a(45) = 13 and A380597(45) = 15.
%C A380598 Can be read as an irregular triangle, whose n-th row contains A000105(n) terms, n >= 1.

%e A380598 For n = 9, the polyomino with binary code A246521(9+1) = 75 is the straight tetromino. Generalized tic-tac-toe for this polyomino (i.e., 4 cells in a row, horizontally or vertically, are needed to win) is a draw for square boards of side length less than 7, but on a 7 X 7 board the first player can force a win in at most 8 moves, so a(9) = 8.
