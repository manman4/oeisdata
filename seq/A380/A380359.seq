%N A380359 a(n) is the number of integers in base n such that all the integers given by their first k digits are divisible by k and which cannot be extended further.
%H A380359 Wikipedia, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polydivisible_number">Polydivisible number</a>.
%e A380359 a(10)=2492 because from all A271374(10)=20457 polydivisible numbers, only 2492 cannot be further expanded into a larger polydivisible number. One such number is 4836545640368400: 4 is divisible by 1, 48 is divisible by 2, 483 is divisible by 3, 4836 is divisible by 4, and so on until 4836545640368400 which is divisible by 16; but one cannot extend it further since no digit (0 to 9) appended to 4836545640368400 would result in a number divisible by k=17.
