%N A380357 a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, and for any n > 0, if a(n) - sign(a(n)) is not yet in the sequence then a(n+1) = a(n) - sign(a(n)), otherwise a(n+1) is the least integer (in absolute value) of opposite sign to a(n), at square distance from a(n) and not yet in the sequence.
%C A380357 This sequence is a variant of A377091 that, by design, contains every integer (positive or negative).

%e A380357 a(0) = 0 and a(1) = 1 by definition.
%e A380357 1 - sign(1) has already appeared, so we chose a(2) = -3.
%e A380357 -3 - sign(-3) has not yet appeared, so a(3) = -3 - sign(-3) = -2.
%e A380357 -2 - sign(-2) has not yet appeared, so a(4) = -2 - sign(-2) = -1.
%e A380357 -1 - sign(-1) has already appeared, so we chose a(5) = 3.
