%N A380855 The unique sequence starting with a(0) = 1, a(1) = 0 and partial sums are 1 followed by the sequence terms themselves repeated in successive blocks a(0..2^k-1) for k >= 0.

%F A380855 a(n) = a(A053645(n)) - a(A053645(n-1)) for n > 1.
%F A380855 a(2^n+2) = 0, for n > 1.
%F A380855 a(2*2^n+1..2*2^(n+1)-1) = a(2*2^(n+1)+1..3*2^(n+1)-1) but a(2*2^n) <= a(3*2^n).
%F A380855 a(2^n+1+k) = a(k+1) - a(k), for 0 <= k < 2^n-1 and n > 0. This property holds also if we replace "a" in this formula by the sequence of forward differences of any order if n is greater than the order of the forward differences.
%e A380855 The defining partial sums as sequence blocks 0..2^k-1 begin
%e A380855   sums  1,  1,    1, 0,   1, 0, 0, -1, ...

%e A380855   blocks   a(0)  a(0..1)    a(0..3)
%e A380855 The formula results in repeats of terms of the sequence itself in blocks,
%e A380855   n=0..1:    1, 0,
%e A380855   n=2:       0,

%e A380855 Terms at n=9..15 repeat in the next row at n=17..23 since A053645 in the formula "drops" each latter n in the same way as each former n, and in general successive rows repeat excluding the last term.
%e A380855 Each of these blocks has zero sum.
