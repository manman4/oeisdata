%N A380530 Positions of records in A380528.
%C A380530 Questions: Are all terms squarefree after 4, and do all terms end (in base ten) with digit 6 from the fifth term onward? Is the sequence infinite? Are there any terms with more than four prime factors? See also the conjecture given in A380475, and A380476.
%C A380530 For n = 1..10, A380528(a(n)) = A008578(n). If a(11) exists, it is > 2^30.
%C A380530 Note that for squarefree n with exactly 5 prime factors (A046387), it might be possible that primes obtained as A380528(A046387(.)) has no upper limit. First k in A046387 such that A380528(k) is a prime 2 .. 17 are: 15015, 2730, 2310, 83886, 1551066, 71559186, 1245223986. See also the last two examples in A380470 for two similar cases with exactly 6 prime factors. - _Antti Karttunen_, May 08 2025
