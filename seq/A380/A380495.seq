%N A380495 Lexicographically earliest infinite sequence of positive integers such that consecutive occurrences of k are separated by k distinct values and each subsequence enclosed by consecutive equal values is distinct.
%C A380495 Since the number of distinct terms in a subsequence is given by its enclosing values, the sequence remains the same whether we include those endpoints or not when checking the uniqueness of subsequences.
%C A380495 Without the condition that subsequences enclosed by consecutive equal values are distinct, this sequence would be A001511 (the ruler function).
%C A380495 Does each value occur finitely many times?

%e A380495 a(7)=4: a(7) cannot be 1 because this would make a(5..7) a repeat of a(1..3) = 1,2,1. a(7) cannot be 2 or 3 as these would not enclose 2 or 3 distinct terms respectively. So a(7) must be 4.
