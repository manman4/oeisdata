%N A380248 The order of the 13 cards of one suit such that after the SpellUnder-Down deal the cards are in order; a(n) is the n-th card in the deck.
%C A380248 Number 1 corresponds to ace, 11 to jack, 12 to queen, 13 to king.
%C A380248 In the SpellUnder-Down deal, we spell the next card, putting a card under for each letter in the name, then we deal the next card. So we start with putting 3 cards under for A-C-E, then deal, then 3 cards under for T-W-O, then deal, then 5 cards under for T-H-R-E-E, then deal. The dealing sequence is highly irregular because it depends on English spelling. The dealing pattern starts: UUUDUUUDUUUUUD.
%C A380248 The sequence is a permutation of 13 numbers.
