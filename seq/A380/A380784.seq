%N A380784 Prime numbers p where the cyclotomic field Q(zeta_(p-1)) has class number one.
%C A380784 For a prime number p, the cyclotomic field of power p-1 can take a significant part in Z/pZ or p-adic field Q_p, since 1~p-1 are all (p-1)-th unit roots in Z/pZ. It would be much better if the cyclotomic integer ring is a unique factorization domain.
%C A380784 A prime number p is in this sequence if and only if (p-1)/2 is in A005848 (if p equals 3 modulus 4) or p-1 is in A005848 (otherwise).
%Y A380784 Cf. A005848.
