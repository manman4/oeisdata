%N A380751 Lexicographically earliest sequence of positive integers such that for any value k, no two sets of one or more indices at which k occurs have the same sum.
%C A380751 The longest run in the sequence has length 3.
%C A380751 The powers of 2 (A000079) are the indices of 1s in this sequence.

%e A380751 a(3) cannot be 1 since i = 1,2 would have the same sum as i = 3. So a(3) = 2.
%e A380751 a(12) cannot be 1 since i = 4,8 would have the same sum as i = 12. a(12) = 2 would give i = 12 the same sum as i = 5,7. a(12) = 3 would give i = 10,11 the same sum as i = 9,12. So a(12) = 4.
