%N A380408 a(n) = Sum_{k>=0} floor(n/(2k)!).
%C A380408 Partial sum of A060832 except for the first term in the sum.
%C A380408 Congruent to A034968(n) mod 2. Therefore, the parity of a(n) is the parity of the n-th permutation of k elements (k>=n) in lexicographic order.
%C A380408 For even n, a(n) equals A059563(n/2) whenever cosh(1)*n - a(n) < 1. The first time this fails is n=70, as a(70)=107 but A059563(35)=108. For small n, such failures appear to be very rare; however, the asymptotic density of these failures approaches 1.
%F A380408 a(n) = cosh(1)*n - f(n) where f(n) = Sum_{k>=0} fract(n/(2k)!). Here, fract() is the fractional part. The error term f(n) is unbounded above, and the greatest lower bound is 0 (even excluding n=0). The first values for which f(n) > s for s=1,2,3 are f(13)=1.06005, f(407) = 2.03382, and f(22319) = 3.01669. The error is almost periodic: for large m, f(n) is approximately f(n+(2m)!). If n is odd, f(n) > 1/2. f(n) alternately rises and descends, that is, f(2*n)<f(2*n+1)>f(2*n+2) for all n.
