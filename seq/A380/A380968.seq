%N A380968 Lexicographically earliest sequence of positive integers such that for any value k, no two sets of one or more indices at which k occurs have the same mean.
%C A380968 A260873 gives the indices of 1s in the sequence.
%C A380968 The longest run in the sequence has length 2.
%C A380968 No three equal terms will appear at indices in arithmetic progression.
%C A380968 For any value k, the distances between pairs of k will be distinct.

%e A380968 a(7) = 3: a(7) cannot be 1 because i = 4; i = 1,7; and i = 1,4,7 would all have the same mean index 4. a(7) cannot be 2 because i = 6; i = 5,6,7; and i = 5,7 would have the same mean index 6. So a(7) = 3.
%e A380968 a(19) cannot be 1, 2, or 3. a(19) = 4 does not work either because i = 13,19 would have the same mean (namely 16) as i = 12,17,19. So a(19) = 5.
