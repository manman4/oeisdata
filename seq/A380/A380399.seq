%F A380399 a(n) = Sum_{d|n, gcd(d, n/d) > 1} [d in A001597], where [] is the Iverson bracket.
%F A380399 a(n) = A091050(n) - A380398(n).
%F A380399 Asymptotic mean: Limit_{m->oo} (1/m) * Sum_{k=1..m} a(k) = A072102 + Sum_{k>=2} mu(k)*(zeta(k)/zeta(k+1) - 1) = Sum_{k>=2} mu(k)*zeta(k)*(1/zeta(k+1)-1) = 0.38105110303589889319..., where mu is the Moebius function (A008683).
%e A380399 a(16) = 2 since 16 have 2 nonunitary divisors that are perfect powers, 4 = 2^2 and 8 = 2^3.
%e A380399 a(32) = 3 since 32 have 3 nonunitary divisors that are perfect powers, 4 = 2^3, 8 = 2^3, and 16 = 2^4.
