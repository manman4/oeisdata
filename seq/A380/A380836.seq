%N A380836 a(n) is the smallest k such that tau(2*k) is equal to 2^n, where tau = A000005.
%C A380836 a(n) = A000028(n+1) | a(n+1) ? [I interpret this as saying "Is it true that if a(n) = A000028(n+1) then a(n) divides a(n+1)?" - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Feb 15 2025]
%C A380836 For n > 2, a(n) is a Zumkeller number (A083207). Proof: Let p_r be the maximum prime in the prime factorization of a(n). First, in the prime factorization p_r must be to the power of one (otherwise we could build a smaller term with the same number of divisors, which would contradict the definition). Second, p_1 must be 2 and floor(log_2(p_r)) <= e_1, where e_1 is the exponent of p_1 (same reason as above). Therefore, there exists a power e <= e_1 such that p_1^e*p_r is a primitive Zumkeller number (see A180332). Then p_1^e1*p is a Zumkeller number (see Theorem 4.13 in Mahanta et al. JNT paper at A083207). Then a(n) = p_1*e_1*p_2^e_2*...*p_r is a Zumkeller number (see Corollary 5 in Rao/Peng JNT paper at A083207). - _Ivan N. Ianakiev_, Feb 15 2025
