%N A164952 Primes p with the property: if p/3 is in the interval (p_m, p_(m+1)), where p_m>=3 and p_k is the k-th prime, then the interval (p, 3p_(m+1)) contains a prime.
%C A164952 For k>1 (not necessarily integer), we call a Ramanujan k-prime R_n^(k) the prime a_k(n) which is the smallest number such that if x >= a_k(n), then pi(x)- pi(x/k) >= n. Note that, the sequence of all primes corresponds to the case of "k=oo". These numbers possess the following properties: R_n^(k)~p_((k/(k-1))n) as n tends to the infinity; if A_k(x) is the counting function of the Ramanujan k-primes not exceeding x, then A_k(x)~(1-1/k)\pi(x) as x tends to the infinity; let p be a Ramanujan k-prime, such that p/k is in the interval (p_m, p_(m+1)), where p_m>=3 and p_n is the n-th prime. Then the interval (p, k*p_(m+1)) contains a prime. Conjecture. For every k>=2 there exist non-Ramanujan k-primes, which possess the latter property. For example, for k=2, the smallest such prime is 109. Problem. For every k>2 to estimate the smallest non-Ramanujan k-prime which possesses the latter property.
%C A164952 All Ramanujan 3-primes are in the sequence.

%e A164952 If p=61, the p/3 is in the interval (19, 23); we see that the interval (61,69) contains a prime (67).
