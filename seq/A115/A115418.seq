%N A115418 a(n) is the shortest possible n-th-power loop where an n-th-power loop of length m > 1 is a circular permutation of the numbers 1 to m such that the sum of any two consecutive numbers is a perfect n-th power.
%C A115418 a(n) can be understood as the minimum integer m such that the following graph is Hamiltonian: The graph has vertices {1,2,...,m} and two vertices are connected with an edge if they sum to an n-th power. Using this interpretation of a(n), it makes more sense to set a(1)=1 (given that the singleton graph is often considered trivially Hamiltonian) or a(1)=3 (given that the graph K_3 is Hamiltonian). - _Stephen Bartell_, Sep 24 2025
%e A115418 a(2) = 32 due to the unique 2nd-power loop of length 32: 1, 8, 28, 21, 4, 32, 17, 19, 30, 6, 3, 13, 12, 24, 25, 11, 5, 31, 18, 7, 29, 20, 16, 9, 27, 22, 14, 2, 23, 26, 10, 15, 1. - _Stephen Bartell_, Sep 24 2025
