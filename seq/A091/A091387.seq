%N A091387 Aronson's mod 13 sequence: "T is the first, fourth, eleventh, third, ... letter in this sentence, not counting spaces or commas and all mod 13".
%C A091387 Infinite? Periodic? It seems the answers are "Yes and No" because many numbers (such as "tenth") have multiple T's and moreover, in many of these, the T's are spread such that at least one of them will be != 2 mod 13 (2 is important because "second" is the only T-less word)
