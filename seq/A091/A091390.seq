%N A091390 Aronson's mod 16 sequence: "T is the first, fourth, eleventh, zeroth, ... letter in this sentence, not counting spaces or commas and all mod 16".
%C A091390 Infinite? Periodic? It seems the answers are "Yes and No" because many numbers (such as "tenth") have multiple T's and moreover, in many of these, the T's are spread such that at least one of them will be != 2 mod 16 (2 is important because "second" is the only T-less word)
