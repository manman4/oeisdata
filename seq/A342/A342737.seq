%N A342737 Number of wedged n-spheres in the homotopy type of the neighborhood complex of Kneser graph KG_{3,n}.
%C A342737 KG_{3,n} is a graph whose vertex set is the collection of subsets of cardinality 3 of set {1,2,...,n+5,n+6} and two subsets are adjacent if and only if they are disjoint. For n >= 0, the neighborhood complex of KG_{3,n} is homotopy equivalent to a wedge of 1 + (n+1)*(n+3)*(n+4)*(n+6)/4 spheres of dimension n.
