%N A384109 Number of connected components of n faces of the truncated icosahedron up to the 120 rotations and reflections of the truncated icosahedron.
%C A384109 Two faces are connected if they share an edge.
%C A384109 These are "free" polyforms because both rotations and reflections are allowed.
%C A384109 The truncated icosahedron is the polyhedral dual of the pentakis dodecahedron.

%e A384109 a(1) = 2 because the truncated dodecahedron is not face transitive, but has two distinct orbits of faces: (1) pentagons and (2) hexagons.
