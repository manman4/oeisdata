%N A384503 Lexicographically earliest infinite sequence of distinct positive integers having the property that for any pair a(n-2) = i, a(n-1) = j of consecutive terms > 1, a(n) is the smallest novel k such that gcd(i,k) > 1 if gcd(i,j) = 1 or gcd(j,k) = 1 if gcd(i,j) > 1.
%C A384503 Three initial terms (1,2,3) are needed since starting 1,2 would require 1 to have a prime factor.
%C A384503 Similar to A280985 except that if for some m, a(m) = prime p, then a(m+2) = 2*p (whereas A280985(m+1) = 2*p).
%C A384503 Conjectured to be a permutation of the positive integers, with primes occurring in order.

%F A384503 For prime a(n) = p, a(n+2) = 2*p. - _Michael De Vlieger_, May 31 2025
%e A384503 The lexicographically earliest condition requires that the sequence starts a(n) = n for n <= 3. Then with a(2) = 2 and a(3) = 3 a(4) must be 4, the smallest novel number sharing a prime divisor with 2 (since gcd(2,3) = 1). Since gcd(3,4) = 1, a(5) must be 6, the smallest novel number sharing a prime divisor with 3. Since gcd(4,6) > 1 a(6) = 5, the smallest novel number prime to a(4) = 4. a(8) = 8 because gcd(6,5) = 1 and then a(9) = 2*5 = 10 the smallest novel number sharing a factor with 5.
