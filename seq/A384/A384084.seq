%N A384084 Numbers whose prime signatures are self-conjugate.
%C A384084 The implied partition corresponding to k is the partition of bigomega(k) (A001222) formed by the prime exponents. For example, bigomega(18) = 3, which is partitioned as 2 + 1, because 18 = (3^2)(2^1), and 2 + 1 is a self-conjugate partition of 3. In contrast, while bigomega(42) = 3, 3 is partitioned as 1 + 1 + 1, because 42 = (2^1)(3^1)(7^1), and 1 + 1 + 1 is not a self-conjugate partition of 3.
%C A384084 This sequence is very similar to, but ultimately different from, A212166. The first difference is a(342) = 1083, whereas A212166(342) = 1080.
%C A384084 This sequence is a subsequence of A212166.
%C A384084 It includes 1 (empty partition) and all primes (A000040: partition 1), as well as numbers of the form (p^2)q, where p and q are distinct primes (A054753: partition 2 + 1).
%C A384084 k is a term in this sequence if and only if A046523(k) is a term in A181825.
