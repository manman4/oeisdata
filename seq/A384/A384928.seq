%N A384928 Number of 2-dense sublists of divisors of the n-th triangular number.
%C A384928 By definition a(n) is also the number of 2-dense sublists of divisors of the n-th generalized hexagonal number.
%C A384928 In a sublist of divisors of k the terms are in increasing order and two adjacent terms are the same two adjacent terms in the list of divisors of k.
%C A384928 The 2-dense sublists of divisors of k are the maximal sublists whose terms increase by a factor of at most 2.
%C A384928 Conjecture: all odd indexed terms are odd.

%F A384928 a(n) = A237271(A000217(n)) for n >= 1 (conjectured).
%e A384928 For n = 5 the 5th triangular number is 15. The list of divisors of 15 is [1, 3, 5, 15]. There are three 2-dense sublists of divisors of 15, they are [1], [3, 5], [15], so a(5) = 3.
%e A384928 For n = 12 the 12th triangular number is 78. The list of divisors of 78 is [1, 2, 3, 6, 13, 26, 39, 78]. There are two 2-dense sublists of divisors of 78, they are [1, 2, 3, 6] and [13, 26, 39, 78], so a(12) = 2. Note that 78 is also the first practical number A005153 not in the sequence of the 2-dense numbers A174973.
