%N A384068 Number of connected components of n faces of the truncated cube up to the 48 rotations and reflections of the truncated cube.
%C A384068 Two faces are connected if they share an edge.
%C A384068 These are "free" polyforms because both rotations and reflections are allowed.
%C A384068 The truncated cube is the polyhedral dual of the triakis octahedron.

%e A384068 a(1) = 2 because the truncated cube is not face-transitive but has two distinct types of faces: triangular faces and octagonal faces.
%Y A384068 Cf. A383800 (triakis octahedron).
%Y A384068 Cf. A384067 (cuboctahedron), A384068 (truncated cube), A384069 (truncated octahedron), A384070 (rhombicuboctahedron), A384071 (truncated cuboctahedron), A384072 (snub cube).
