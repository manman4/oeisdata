%N A384045 a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2; for n > 2, a(n) is the smallest unused positive number that shares a factor with a(n-1) if it is greater than it, else it is coprime to a(n-1) if it is less than it.
%C A384045 For the terms studied all primes appear in their natural order, and approximately 65% of all primes p are immediately followed by a term 2*p. These later terms form the upper of the two lines in the graph.
%C A384045 In the first 100000 terms the fixed points are 1, 2, 12, 18, 98, 182, 306, 380; it is likely no more exist.
%C A384045 The sequence is a permutation of the positive integers as the lowest unused number after k terms will always appear as it will eventually be coprime to a(j) for some j > k.
