%N A384529 Number of inequivalent sets S (cubic acute n-set), with cardinality A089676(n) >= 3, of points in {0,1}^n in real n-dimensional Euclidean space such that every angle determined by three distinct points in S is acute.
%C A384529 Consider the 2^n points {0,1}^n in real Euclidean space. Then A089676(n) = maximal size of a subset S of these 2^n points such that there is no triple of points P, Q, R in S which subtends a right angle. That is, we are not allowed to have P-Q perpendicular to R-Q. Here we count such inequivalent sets of points under permutation of their coordinates.
