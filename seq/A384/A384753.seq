%N A384753 Order of the permutation of {1,...,n} formed by a Josephus elimination variation: take 2, skip 1.
%C A384753 The Josephus elimination begins with a circular list {1,...,n} from which successively take 2 elements and skip 1, and the permutation is the elements taken in the order they're taken.
%C A384753 The same effect can be had by leaving remaining elements at the end of a flat list of {1,...,n} and applying the "skip" as a move (rotate) of the element at position 2*i+3 to the end of the list, for successive i >= 0.
%C A384753 Take 2 and move 1 is a move every 3rd element, but with the next 3 elements reckoned inclusive of the element which replaced the moved 1, and hence positions 2 apart.
%C A384753 A given element can be skipped or moved multiple times before reaching its final position.
%C A384753 The value of a(n) can vary sharply; for example, a(62) = 280, a(63) = 15939, a(64) = 210.
%e A384753 For n=10, the rotations to construct the permutation are
%e A384753     1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
%e A384753           \-----------------------/  1st rotation
%e A384753     1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 3
%e A384753                 \-----------------/  2nd rotation
%e A384753     1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 3, 6
%e A384753                       \-----------/  3rd rotation
%e A384753     1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 3, 6, 9
%e A384753                              \----/  4th rotation
%e A384753     1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 3, 9, 6
%e A384753 The 4th rotate is an example of an element (6) which was previously rotated to the end, being rotated to the end again.
%e A384753 This final permutation has order a(10) = 7 (applying it 7 times reaches the identity permutation again).
