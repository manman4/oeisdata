%N A384112 Number of connected components of n faces of the snub dodecahedron up to the 60 rotations of the snub dodecahedron.
%C A384112 Two faces are connected if they share an edge.
%C A384112 These are "one-sided" polyforms because rotations are allowed but reflections are not allowed.
%C A384112 The snub dodecahedron is the polyhedral dual of the pentagonal hexecontahedron.

%e A384112 a(1) = 3 because the snub dodecahedron is not face transitive, but has three distinct orbits of faces: (1) pentagons, (2) triangles that are connected to a pentagon, and (3) triangles that are not connected to a pentagon.
