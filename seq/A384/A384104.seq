%N A384104 Number of edge-connected components of n faces of the truncated tetrahedron up to the 24 rotations and reflections of the truncated tetrahedron.
%C A384104 Two faces are connected if they share an edge.
%C A384104 These are "free" polyforms because both rotations and reflections are allowed.
%C A384104 The truncated tetrahedron is the polyhedral dual of the triakis tetrahedron.

%e A384104 a(1) = 2 because the truncated tetrahedron is not face-transitive but has two distinct types of faces: triangular faces and hexagonal faces.
%Y A384104 Cf. A383825 (triakis tetrahedron).
%Y A384104 Cf. A384067 (cuboctahedron), A384068 (truncated cube), A384069 (truncated octahedron), A384070 (rhombicuboctahedron), A384071 (cuboctahedron), A384072 (snub cube).
