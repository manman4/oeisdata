%N A384797 a(n) = A047800(n) - A047800(n-1).
%C A384797 This is the number of distinct positive distances of the [0,n] X [0,n] points of a lattice square from the origin that are added when the size of the square is increased from n-1 to n. Among the newly added squared distances n^2, n^2+1^2, n^2+2^2, ..., n^2+n^2, some may already have occurred in smaller lattice point squares and are therefore not counted.

%e A384797 a(1) = 2: Newly added squared distances are 1 and 2.
%e A384797 a(5) = 5: The squared distance 25=5^2+0^2 already occurs as 4^2+3^2.
%e A384797 a(13) = 11: There are 3 already represented squared distances, 13^2+0^2=12^2+5^2, 13^2+1^2=11^2+7^2, 13^2+4^2=11^2+8^2.
