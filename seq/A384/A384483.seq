%N A384483 Length of shortest addition-composition chain for n, starting with 1 and x.
%C A384483 See A384480 for the definition of addition-composition chains. The number n is identified with the constant function f(x) = n.
%F A384483 a(n) <= A003313(n).
%F A384483 a(n) <= a(n-1) + 1.
%e A384483 The smallest n for which a(n) < A003313(n) is n = 21. The length of a shortest addition chain for 21 is A003313(21) = 6, but there are addition-composition chains of length 5, for example (1, x,) x+1, 2*x+2, 3*x+3, 6, 21. 6 and 21 are the compositions of 3*x+3 with 1 and 6, respectively.
%Y A384483 Row 0 of A384480 for columns k >= 1.
