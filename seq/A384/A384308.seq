%N A384308 a(1) = 3; for n > 1, a(n) is the smallest number that has not appeared before and has the same set of prime divisors as a(n-1) + 1.
%C A384308 Theorem 1: {a(n)} is a permutation of the positive integers greater than 1.
%C A384308 Proof: Suppose the smallest positive integer greater than 1 that does not appear in this sequence is m, whose set of prime divisors is {p1, p2, ..., pk}. Since there are infinitely many numbers with this set of prime divisors, we know that either all of them appear or none of them appear. Since m is the smallest among them, we know that m = p1*p2*...*pk. Therefore, p1*p2*...*pk - 1 does not appear, a contradiction, implying that all integers greater than one appear in {a(n)}. Since there are no repetitions by the definition, we have proven that {a(n)} is a permutation of the positive integers greater than 1.
%C A384308 From _Yifan Xie_, May 26 2025: (Start)
%C A384308 Theorem 2: The parity of a(n) is the same as the parity of n.
%C A384308 Proof: Since a(1) is odd, we only need to prove that an odd term is immediately followed by an even term, and an even term is immediately followed by an odd term. If a(n-1) is odd, the set of prime divisors of a(n-1) + 1 contains 2, so a(n) is even; If a(n-1) and a(n) are both even, the set of prime divisors of a(n-1) + 1 does not contain 2, so a(n)/2 is a smaller candidate for a(n), a contradiction.

%e A384308 For a(5) = 11, 11 + 1 = 12, its set of prime divisors is {2, 3}. The smallest number with the same set of prime divisors that has not appeared before is 6, so a(6) = 6.
