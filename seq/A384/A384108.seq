%N A384108 Number of connected components of n faces of the truncated dodecahedron up to the 120 rotations and reflections of the truncated dodecahedron.
%C A384108 Two faces are connected if they share an edge.
%C A384108 These are "free" polyforms because both rotations and reflections are allowed.
%C A384108 The truncated dodecahedron is the polyhedral dual of the triakis icosahedron.

%e A384108 a(1) = 2 because the truncated dodecahedron is not face transitive, but has two distinct orbits of faces: (1) triangles and (2) decagons.
