%N A384110 Number of connected components of n faces of the rhombicosidodecahedron up to the 120 rotations and reflections of the rhombicosidodecahedron.
%C A384110 Two faces are connected if they share an edge.
%C A384110 These are "free" polyforms because both rotations and reflections are allowed.
%C A384110 The rhombicosidodecahedron is the polyhedral dual of the deltoidal hexecontahedron.

%e A384110 a(1) = 3 because the rhombicosidodecahedron is not face transitive, but has three distinct orbits of faces: (1) triangles, (2) squares, and (3) pentagons.
