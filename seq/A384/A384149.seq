%N A384149 Irregular triangle T(n, k) in which row n gives the 2-densely-aggregated composition of sigma(n).
%C A384149 We form the 2-densely-aggregated composition of sigma(n) = A000203(n) by listing the divisors of n in increasing order and assigning adjacent divisors for summation in the same aggregate if (and only if) they differ by a factor of less than or equal to 2. The ordering of the aggregate sums in the composition follows the ordering of the summed divisors.
%C A384149 We follow here the use of 2-dense/2-densely reported in the comments of A174973.
%C A384149 If n is in A174973 then row n has length 1 and its sole term is sigma(n).
%C A384149 From empirical evidence of the first 1000 rows, reinforced by some known related properties, it looks readily credible that if we take the average of row n and its reversal we get A237270 row n, a palindromic composition of sigma(n) that was defined using Dyck paths. Row lengths are therefore conjectured to be in the database as A237271.
%e A384149 For row 9: the ordered divisors of 9 are (1, 3, 9). Adjacent divisors differ by a factor of 3, which is greater than 2, so each divisor is trivially summed into a separate aggregate and the 2-densely-aggregated composition of sigma(9) is (1, 3, 9).
%e A384149 For row 12, the ordered divisors of 12 are (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12). Every pair of adjacent divisors differs by a factor <= 2, so they are summed in a single aggregate and the 2-densely-aggregated composition of sigma(12) is (1+2+3+4+6+12) = (28).
%e A384149 For row 10, the ordered divisors of 10 are (1, 2, 5, 10). The adjacent divisors (1, 2) and (5, 10) differ by a factor of 2, but (2, 5) differ by a larger factor, so there are 2 aggregates and the 2-densely-aggregated composition of sigma(10) is (1+2, 5+10) = (3, 15).
%e A384149 For 29029 = 7 * 11 * 13 * 29, the 2-densely-aggregated composition of sigma(29029) is (1, 7+11+13, 29, 77+91+143+203+319+377, 1001, 2233+2639+4147, 29029) = (1, 31, 29, 1210, 1001, 9019, 29029). Note that this composition is not in ascending order.
