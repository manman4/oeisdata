%N A384275 a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2, a(3) = 4; for n > 3, a(n) is the smallest unused positive number that shares a factor with a(n-1) and at least one other previous term.
%C A384275 For the terms studied, the primes appear in their natural order, and except for a(8) = 3, all other prime terms p are preceded by 3*p and followed by 4*p. The primes p and the terms 4*p form the lower and upper lines of the graph.
%C A384275 In the first 100000 terms the only fixed points are 1, 2, 9; it is likely no more exist. The sequence is conjectured to be a permutation of the positive integers.

%e A384275 a(8) = 3 as a(7) = 12 and a(4) = 6, and 3 shares a factor with 12, the previous term, and also with 6.
