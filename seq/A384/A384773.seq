%N A384773 a(1) = 1, a(2) = 1. For n > 2 if a(n-1) = k is a novel term, a(n) = a(n-1-k). Otherwise if a(n-1) is a repeat term a(n) = number of m; 1 <= m <= n-2 such that a(m) = a(n-1).
%C A384773 a(n) <= n for all n, with equality for n = 1. Same as A364749 until a(12).
%C A384773 The sequence of indices of terms a(n-1-k) following novel terms k (starting: 2,3,4,6,8,10,11,13,...) appears to be A335999.
%C A384773 Records subsequence is A000027, with records occurring at indices 1, A026278.

%e A384773 a(1) = a(2) = 1 implies a(3) = 1 since 1 has been repeated once. Then a(4) = 2 because now 1 has been repeated twice. Since 2 is a novel term a(5) = a(4-2) = a(2) = 1. Since 1 has been repeated three times a(6) = 3, another novel term so a(7) = a(6-3) = a(3) = 1.
