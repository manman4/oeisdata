%N A384424 The maximal possible number of 'good' steps in a Hamiltonian cycle on the n X n king's graph, as is specified in the comments.
%C A384424 The cycle is drawn on an n X n square grid. Denote the geometric center of the grid by O. An edge a -> b on the cycle is 'good' if the distance from b to O is strictly less than the distance from a to O.
%C A384424 The n = 8 case is Grade 9, Problem 4 of 2025 All-Russian Olympiad.
%H A384424 Yifan Xie, <a href="/A384424/a384424_2.png">Illustration of a(n), n = 2..8</a>, 'good' steps are green, the others are blue and the red circles are the centers of the grids (the construction for n = 6 from Sean A. Irvine).
%e A384424 Proof that a(6) <= 24: Mark the cells on a 6 X 6 grid with the following symbols:
%e A384424   ABXXBA
%e A384424   BXXXXB
%e A384424   XXOOXX
%e A384424   XXOOXX
%e A384424   BXXXXB
%e A384424   ABXXBA
%e A384424 The 4 steps to A and the 4 steps from O must be non-'good'. For each A, the 2 steps to the neighboring B's cannot both be 'good', or they must both be A -> B. So there are at least 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 non-'good' steps, hence a(6) <= 24.
