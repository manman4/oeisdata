%N A384035 Number of vector differences between two permutations of order n, up to multiplication by positive rational numbers and permutations of the components.
%e A384035 For n = 3, there are A019589(3) = 5 difference vectors up to permutation of components: (-2, 0, 2), (-2, 1, 1), (-1, -1, 2), (-1, 0, 1), and (0, 0, 0). However, (-2, 0, 2) and (-1, 0, 1) are the same up to a factor 2. Hence, a(3) = 4.
%Y A384035 Cf. A019589, A175176, A362968, A381243, A381244, A381339.
