%N A384001 Irregular triangle T(n,j,k), j = 1..A024718(n), k = 1..n, where row 1 = {(0), (1)}, and row n = union of n-tuples whose sum s < n, and the n-tuples formed by appending s to the (n-1)-tuples in row n-1.
%C A384001 Terms in row n are sorted lexicographically.
%C A384001 Row n is created by finding n-tuples w with elements from 0..n-1, taking only those w whose sums are less than n.
%C A384001 For example, row n = 3 contains 3-tuples w that have elements from 0..2, i.e., {(0,0,0), (0,0,1), (0,0,2), (0,1,0), (0,1,1), (0,2,0), (1,0,0), (1,0,1), (1,1,0), (2,0,0)}.
%C A384001 Let s be the sum of w. Then we take all elements w of row n-1 and append n-s to w to obtain certain 3-tuples with elements from 0..n whose sum s = n.
%C A384001 Continuing the example, row 2 = {(0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1)}, which, adding n-s to the right end gives {(0,0,3), (0,1,2), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (1,1,1)}.
%C A384001 Let p_i be the i-th smallest prime divisor of N = A384000(n) (where i is not necessarily the i-th prime). Then, the terms m in row N of A162306 are of the form m = Product_{i..n} p_i^T(n,j,n-k+1). For instance, for N = 6, we have row 6 of A162306 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6}, which is {2^0*3^0, 2^1*3^0, 2^2*3^0, 2^0*3^1, 2^1*3^1} = {1, 2, 4, 3, 6}, sorted.
%F A384001 Length of row n = n*A024718(n).
