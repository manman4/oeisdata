%N A384931 Number of 2-dense sublists of divisors of the number of partitions of n.
%C A384931 In a 2-dense sublist of divisors of k the terms are in increasing order and two adjacent terms are the same two adjacent terms in the list of divisors of k.
%C A384931 The 2-dense sublists of divisors of k are the maximal sublists whose terms increase by a factor of at most 2.

%F A384931 a(n) = A237271(A000041(n)). Conjectured.
%e A384931 For n = 7 the number of partitions of 7 is A000041(7) = 15. The list of divisors of 15 is [1, 3, 5, 15]. There are three 2-dense sublists of divisors of 15, they are [1], [3, 5], [15], so a(7) = 3.
%e A384931 For n = 19 the number of partitions of 19 is A000041(19) = 490. The list of divisors of 490 is [1, 2, 5, 7, 10, 14, 35, 49, 70, 98, 245, 490]. There are four 2-dense sublists of divisors of 490, they are [1, 2], [5, 7, 10, 14], [35, 49, 70, 98], [245, 490], so a(19) = 4.
