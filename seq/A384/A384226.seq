%N A384226 Irregular triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the sum of odd divisors in the k-th 2-dense sublist of divisors of n, with n >= 1, k >= 1.
%C A384226 T(n,k) is the sum of odd numbers in the k-th sublist (or subsequence) of divisors of n such that the ratio of adjacent divisors in every sublist is at most 2.
%C A384226 In a sublist of divisors of n the terms are in increasing order and two adjacent terms are the same two adjacent terms in the list of divisors of n.
%C A384226 It shares the odd-indexed rows with A384149.
%C A384226 At least for the first 1000 rows the row lengths give A237271.

%e A384226 For n = 14 the list of divisors of 14 is [1, 2, 7, 14]. There are two sublists of divisors of 14 whose terms increase by a factor of at most 2, they are [1, 2] and [7, 14]. The sums of odd terms in the sublists are [1], [7] respectively, so the row 14 is [1, 7].
%e A384226 For n = 15 the list of divisors of 15 is [1, 3, 5, 15]. There are three sublists of divisors of 15 whose terms increase by a factor of at most 2, they are [1], [3, 5], [15]. The sums of terms in the sublists are [1, 8, 15] respectively, so the row 15 is [1, 8, 15].
%e A384226 For n = 16 the list of divisors of 16 is [1, 2, 4, 8, 16]. There is only one sublist of divisors of 16 whose terms increase by a factor of at most 2, that is the same as the list of divisors of 16, so the row 16 is [1].
%e A384226 For n = 2350 the list of divisors of 2350 is [1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 47, 50, 94, 235, 470, 1175, 2350]. There are five sublists of divisors of 2350 whose terms increase by a factor of at most 2, they are [1, 2], [5, 10], [25, 47, 50, 94], [235, 470], [1175, 2350]. The sums of odd terms in the sublists are [1, 5, 72, 235, 1175] respectively, so the row 2350 is [1, 5, 72, 235, 1175].
