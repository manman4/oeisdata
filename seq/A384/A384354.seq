%N A384354 Numbers k such that the arithmetic mean of the divisors of k evenly divides k+1.
%C A384354 A term k with a fractional arithmetic mean of divisors is allowed as long as that arithmetic mean evenly divides k+1.
%C A384354 There exist triples such as (19,20,21) and quadruples such as (1,2,3,4) of consecutive numbers where the arithmetic mean of the divisors of every earlier number evenly divides the immediately following number. Are there similar quintuples?
%C A384354 Contains every prime p since (1+p)/2 evenly divides 1+p. - _Michael S. Branicky_, May 29 2025
%e A384354 2 is a term since (1+2)/2 = 3/2 and 3/2 evenly divides 3.
%e A384354 19 is a term since (1+19)/2 is 10 and 10 evenly divides 20.
%e A384354 20 is a term since (1+2+4+5+10+20)/6 = 7 and 7 evenly divides 21.
