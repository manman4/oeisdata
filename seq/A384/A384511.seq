%N A384511 a(n) is the number of ways to partition n X n X n cube into five distinct cuboids with three full-length axial spanning parts sharing only two cube corners each.
%C A384511 Alternatively a(n) is the number of distinct sets of five unordered triplets of distinct element composition generated by (x,n,z), (n,y,n-z), (n-x,n-y,n), (n-x,y,z), (x,n-y,n-z), where 0 < x,y,z < n.
%C A384511 Three elements in a triplet representing the three dimensions of a cuboid and exactly three of the five cuboids span through the entire length n along one axis, connecting opposite faces of the cube while sharing only two of their corners with the cube.

%e A384511 Triplet (3,3,3) can be decomposed by the rule in only one way:
%e A384511   {(1,3,1), (3,1,2), (2,2,3), (2,1,1), (1,2,2)}.
%e A384511 Therefore, a(3) = 1.
%e A384511 Triplet (4,4,4) can be decomposed by the rule in only three different ways:
%e A384511   {(1,4,1), (4,1,3), (3,3,4), (3,1,1), (1,3,3)},
%e A384511   {(1,4,2), (4,2,2), (3,2,4), (3,2,2), (1,2,2)},
%e A384511   {(1,4,3), (4,2,1), (3,2,4), (3,2,3), (1,2,1)}.
%e A384511 Therefore, a(4) = 3.
