%N A384146 Smallest squarefree order m > 0 for which there are n nonisomorphic finite groups of order m, or 0 if no such order exists.
%C A384146 It has been established that every n < 10000000 arises as the number of groups up to isomorphism of some squarefree m. That is, a(n) > 0 for n < 10000000.
%C A384146 It is conjectured that 0 never appears in this sequence.

%e A384146 a(3)=609 since there are 3 groups of order 609 up to isomorphism, and 609 is the smallest squarefree integer such that there are 3 groups of that order.
%Y A384146 Cf. A046057 (m not necessarily squarefree).
