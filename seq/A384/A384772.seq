%N A384772 Triangle read by row: T(n,k) is the number of the k-th eliminated person in a variant of the Josephus problem in which first three people are skipped, then one is eliminated, repeating until all n people are eliminated.
%C A384772 The numbers 1 through n are arranged in a circle. A pointer starts at position 1. With each turn, the pointer skips three numbers and the next number is eliminated. The process repeats until no numbers remain. This sequence is a concatenation of the rows of the triangle T, where T(n, k) is the elimination order of the k-th number in a circle of n  numbers.
%C A384772 This variation of the Josephus problem can equivalently be described in terms of under-under-under-down card dealing, where the cards of a deck are dealt by alternately cycling three cards from the top "under", and then dealing the next card "down". In particular, T(n,k) is the k-th card dealt in under-under-under-down dealing if the deck begins in order 1,2,3,...,n.

%e A384772 Consider 4 people in a circle. Initially, people numbered 1, 2, and 3 are skipped, and person 4 is eliminated. The remaining people are now in order 1, 2, 3. Then all three are skipped and person 1 is eliminated. The remaining people are in order 2, 3. Now, we skip over 2, 3, 2 and eliminate person 3. Person 2 is eliminated last. Thus, the fourth row of the triangle is 4, 1, 3, 2.
%e A384772 The triangle begins as follows:
%e A384772   1;
%e A384772   2, 1;

%e A384772   4, 1, 3, 2;
