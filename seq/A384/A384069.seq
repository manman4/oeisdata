%N A384069 Number of connected components of n faces of the truncated octahedron up to the 48 rotations and reflections of the truncated octahedron.
%C A384069 Two faces are connected if they share an edge.
%C A384069 These are "free" polyforms because both rotations and reflections are allowed.
%C A384069 The truncated octahedron is the polyhedral dual of the tetrakis hexahedron.

%e A384069 a(1) = 2 because the truncated octahedron is not face-transitive but has two distinct types of faces: square faces and hexagonal faces.
%Y A384069 Cf. A383802 (tetrakis hexahedron).
%Y A384069 Cf. A384067 (cuboctahedron), A384068 (truncated cube), A384069 (truncated octahedron), A384070 (rhombicuboctahedron), A384071 (truncated cuboctahedron), A384072 (snub cube).
