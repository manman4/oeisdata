%e A384254 For n=1, the a(1)=2 different components are the cuboctahedron and the octahedron.
%e A384254 For n=2, the a(2)=1 component is a cuboctahedron connected to an octahedron.
%e A384254 For n=3, there are A000162(3)=2 components that consist of three cuboctahedra, four connected components that consist of two cuboctahedra and an octahedron, and three components that consist of a cuboctahedron and two octahedra.
