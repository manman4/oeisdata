%N A384384 Length of shortest addition-multiplication-composition chain for n, starting with 1 and x.
%C A384384 See A384383 for the definition of addition-multiplication-composition chains. The number n is identified with the constant polynomial p(x) = n.
%F A384384 a(n) <= A230697(n).
%F A384384 a(n) <= a(n-1) + 1.
%e A384384 The smallest n for which a(n) < A230697(n) is n = 31. The length of a shortest addition-multiplication chain for 31 is A230697(31) = 6, but there are addition-multiplication-composition chains of length 5, for example (1, x,) 2*x, 2*x+1, 4*x+3, 7, 31. (4*x+3 is the composition of 2*x+1 with itself; 7 and 31 are the compositions of 4*x+3 with 1 and 7, respectively.)
%Y A384384 Cf. A230697 (addition and multiplication), A384383, A384385, A384386, A384483 (addition and composition).
