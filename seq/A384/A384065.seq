%N A384065 Cardinality of the lattice of order ideals for every order ideal in the lattice of normal subgroups of the dihedral group D_{2*n}.
%C A384065 An order ideal I is a nonempty subset of a partially ordered set P where y <= x for x in I and y in P implies y is in I. The set of order ideals of a partially ordered set is a lattice (ordered by inclusion) and is distributive.
%C A384065 The lattice of normal subgroups of any group is distributive and also modular.
%C A384065 The number of order ideals in the lattice of normal subgroups of D_{2*n} is a(n)-1 since the empty set is not an order ideal.

%F A384065 a(n) > A037852(n).
%F A384065 a(p) = 4 for every prime p > 2.
%e A384065 a(1) = 3 since for D_{2} = C_2 the lattice of normal subgroups L = {1, C_2} and the lattice of order ideals of L contains {}, {1}, and L.
%e A384065 a(2) = 10 since for D_{4} = (C_2 x C_2) the lattice of normal subgroups L = {1, C_2, C_2, C_2, (C_2 x C_2)} and the lattice of order ideals of L contains {}, {1}, {1, C_2}, {1, C_2}, {1, C_2}, {1, C_2, C_2}, {1, C_2, C_2}, {1, C_2, C_2}, {1, C_2, C_2, C_2}, and L.
