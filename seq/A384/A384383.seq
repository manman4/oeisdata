%N A384383 Number of polynomials with a shortest addition-multiplication-composition chain of length n, starting with 1 and x.
%C A384383 An addition-multiplication-composition chain for the polynomial p(x) is a finite sequence of polynomials, starting with 1, x and ending with p(x), in which each element except 1 and x equals q(x)+r(x), q(x)*r(x), or q(r(x)) for two preceding, not necessarily distinct, elements q(x) and r(x) in the chain. The length of the chain is the number of elements in the chain, excluding 1 and x.
%e A384383 An example of a polynomial for which composition is necessary to obtain the shortest chain is 9*x, with the chain (1, x,) 2*x, 3*x, 9*x. (9*x is the composition of 3*x with itself.) So 9*x is one of the 11 polynomials counted by a(3) but not by A384382(3).
