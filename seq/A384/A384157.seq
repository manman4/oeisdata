%N A384157 Irregular triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of connected induced k-vertex subgraphs of the hyperoctahedral graph of dimension n >= 1 up to automorphisms of the hyperoctahedral graph; 0 <= k <= 2*n.
%C A384157 In this sequence, the empty graph is considered to be connected.
%C A384157 There are n!*2^n graph automorphisms of the n-hyperoctahedral graph.
%C A384157 The hyperoctahedral graph is also called the "cocktail party graph," and corresponds to the 1-skeleton of the n-dimensional cross-polytope.
%C A384157 Row 3 corresponds to the number of polyominoes on the faces of a cube up to rotation and reflection of the cube.
%C A384157 More generally, this sequence gives the number of k-celled polyforms whose cells are (n-1)-dimensional facets of the n-dimensional hypercube.
%C A384157 An induced subgraph of the hyperoctahedral graph is completely determined (up to automorphisms of the hyperoctahedral graph) by the number i of pairs of antipodal vertices and the number j of vertices whose antipode is not in the subgraph. The subgraph is disconnected if and only if i=1 and j=0. This implies a close relation to A008967 (which also counts disconnected subgraphs); see formula.
