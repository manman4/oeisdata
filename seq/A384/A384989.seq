%N A384989 Order of the permutation of [n] formed by a Josephus elimination variation: take 3, skip 1.
%C A384989 The Josephus elimination begins with a circular list [n] from which successively take 3 elements and skip 1, and the permutation is the elements taken in the order they're taken.
%C A384989 The same effect can be had by leaving remaining elements at the end of a flat list of [n] and applying the "skip" as a move (rotate) of the element at position 3*i+4 to the end of the list, for successive i >= 0.
%C A384989 Take 3 and move 1 is a move every 4th element, but with the next 4 elements reckoned inclusive of the element which replaced the moved 1, and hence positions 3 apart.
%C A384989 A given element can be skipped or moved multiple times before reaching its final position.

%e A384989 For n=11, the rotations to construct the permutation are
%e A384989     1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11
%e A384989              \------------------------/  1st rotation
%e A384989     1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 4
%e A384989                       \---------------/  2nd rotation
%e A384989     1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 4, 8
%e A384989                                  \----/  3rd rotation
%e A384989     1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 8, 4
%e A384989 The 3rd rotate is an example of an element (4) which was previously rotated to the end, being rotated to the end again.
%e A384989 This final permutation has order a(11) = 6 (applying it 6 times reaches the identity permutation again).
