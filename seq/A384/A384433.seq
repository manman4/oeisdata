%N A384433 Integers k that are equal to the sum of at least two distinct of their anagrams, which must have the same number of digits as k.
%C A384433 This sequence consists of integers k that are equal to the sum of at least two of their own digit permutations. All anagrams must have the same number of digits as k, so permutations with leading zeros are not allowed.
%C A384433 Unlike Osiris numbers (A319274), which are formed by summing permutations of digit subsamples, these numbers require the use of all digits in each term of the sum.
%C A384433 All terms are divisible by 3. Proof: if a term t is in the sequence then it is a sum of at least 2 anagrams and at most 9 anagrams. The remainder of any q anagrams of t is (q*t) mod 9 which is never equivalent t mod 9 since t mod 3 is nonzero. - _David A. Corneth_, Jun 05 2025

%e A384433 4617 is in this list, since 4617 = 1467 + 1476 + 1674, where 1467, 1476 and 1674 are anagrams of 4617.
%e A384433 921 is not in the sequence even though 921 = 192 + 219 + 219 + 291. - _David A. Corneth_, Jun 05 2025
