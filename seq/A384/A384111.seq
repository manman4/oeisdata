%N A384111 Number of connected components of n faces of the truncated icosidodecahedron up to the 120 rotations and reflections of the truncated icosidodecahedron.
%C A384111 Two faces are connected if they share an edge.
%C A384111 These are "free" polyforms because both rotations and reflections are allowed.
%C A384111 The truncated icosidodecahedron is the polyhedral dual of the disdyakis triacontahedron.

%e A384111 a(1) = 3 because the truncated icosidodecahedron is not face transitive, but has three distinct orbits of faces: (1) squares, (2) hexagons, and (3) decagons.
