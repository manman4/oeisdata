%N A384564 a(n) = the least natural number not already in the sequence whose prime signature is conjugate to that of n.
%C A384564 This sequence is an involutory (period 2) permutation of the natural numbers. Its graph is symmetric in the line a(n) = n. It fixes all numbers with self-conjugate prime signatures (A384084), including 1 and the primes (A000040). It exchanges prime squares (A001248) and products of two distinct primes (A006881). It exchanges powers of 2 (A000079) with primorials (A002110).
%e A384564 The implied partition corresponding to k is the partition of bigomega(k) (A001222) formed by the prime exponents. For example, bigomega(18) = 3, which is partitioned as 2 + 1, because 18 = (3^2)*(2^1). Because this is a self-conjugate partition, a(18) = 18. Similarly, bigomega(42) = 3, which is partitioned as 1 + 1 + 1, because 42 = (2^1)*(3^1)*(7^1). The conjugate partition is 3, so a(42) is the cube of a prime.
