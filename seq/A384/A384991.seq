%N A384991 Order of the permutation of [n] formed by a Josephus elimination variation: take p, skip 1, with p starting at 2 and advancing to the next prime after each skip.
%C A384991 The Josephus elimination begins with a circular list [n] from which successively take p elements and skip 1 where p begins at 2 and increases to the next prime (3,5,7,11,13,...) after each skip, and the permutation is the elements taken in the order they're taken.
%C A384991 Let p(k) be the k-th prime number, and let k increment with each move. In this variation, "take p(k), skip 1" means: move the p(k)-th element to the end of the list. After each move, counting begins from the element that replaced the moved one, and the next move targets the subsequent p(k+1)-th element. Thus, the positions of the elements being moved are p(k+1)-1 apart.
%C A384991    That is, the moved positions follow this progression:
%C A384991       Position Moved       Differences Between Positions

%e A384991 The 4th rotate is an example of an element (5) which was previously rotated to the end, being rotated to the end again.
%e A384991 This final permutation has order a(15) = 45 (applying it 45 times reaches the identity permutation again).
