%N A384502 Maximum number of distinct prime factors in an n-digit number, n > 3, where its set of distinct prime factors can be partitioned into two equal-sum subsets, each containing at least two elements.

%F A384502 a(n) <= (largest m such that A067175(m) <= n).
%e A384502 a(4) = 5, since 2310 = 2 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 11 is a 4-digit number with omega(2310) = 5, and its prime factors can be split into two equal-sum parts: 2 + 5 + 7 = 3 + 11. No 4-digit number that meets this partitioning criterion has an omega value exceeding 5.
