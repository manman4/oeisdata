%N A384071 Number of connected components of n faces of the truncated cuboctahedron up to the 48 rotations and reflections of the truncated cuboctahedron.
%C A384071 Two faces are connected if they share an edge.
%C A384071 These are "free" polyforms because both rotations and reflections are allowed.
%C A384071 The truncated cuboctahedron is the polyhedral dual of the disdyakis dodecahedron.

%e A384071 a(1) = 3 because the truncated cuboctahedron is not face-transitive but has three distinct types of faces: square faces, hexagonal faces, and octagonal faces.
%Y A384071 Cf. A383806 (disdyakis dodecahedron).
