%N A384990 Order of the permutation of [n] formed by a Josephus elimination variation: take k, skip 1, with k starting at 1 and increasing by 1 after each skip.
%C A384990 The Josephus elimination begins with a circular list [n] from which successively take k elements and skip 1 where k begins at 1 and monotonically increases after each skip, and the permutation is the elements taken in the order they're taken.
%C A384990 Take k and move 1 is a move every k-th element, but with the next k+1 elements reckoned inclusive of the element which replaced the moved 1, and hence positions k apart.
%C A384990 A given element can be skipped or moved multiple times before reaching its final position.
%C A384990 This sequence enters relatively lengthy stretches of linearity where a(n) = n-1 before entering stretches where it oscillates between n-1 and much larger values.  This behavior is observed multiple times between a(1) and a(1000).  It is unknown if this behavior continues to happen further into the sequence.  For example: a(n)=n-1 for n=905 to 946, and the terms that follow are 9419588158802421600, 947, 224555, 949, 1582305192, 951, 226455, 953, etc.
%e A384990 For n=10, the rotations to construct the permutation are
%e A384990     1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
%e A384990        \--------------------------/  1st rotation (k=1)
%e A384990     1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 2
%e A384990           \-----------------------/  2nd rotation (k=2)
%e A384990     1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 2, 4
%e A384990                 \-----------------/  3rd rotation (k=3)
%e A384990     1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 2, 4, 7
%e A384990                           \-------/  4th rotation (k=4)
%e A384990     1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 4, 7, 2
%e A384990 The 4th rotate is an example of an element (2) which was previously rotated to the end, being rotated to the end again.
%e A384990 This final permutation has order a(10) = 9 (applying it 9 times reaches the identity permutation again).
