%N A384606 Possible values for the number of groups of order equal to a prime power, in order of first appearance.
%C A384606 Equal A098885 with the duplicate entries removed.
%C A384606 a(14) = A000001(2048) (this value is currently unknown).
%C A384606 This sequence is the same regardless of whether 1 is considered a prime power or not (see A000961 for discussion on this) as A000001(1) = A000001(p) = 1 for all p.
%e A384606 1 is in this sequence because A000001(2) = 1.
%e A384606 2 is in this sequence because A000001(2^2) = 2.
%e A384606 5 is in this sequence because A000001(2^3) = 5.
%e A384606 3 is not in this sequence as no prime power p^k has A000001(p^k)=3.
%Y A384606 Cf. A098885, A384607.
