%N A384067 Number of edge-connected components of n faces of the cuboctahedron up to the 48 rotations and reflections of the cuboctahedron.
%C A384067 Two faces are connected if they share an edge.
%C A384067 These are "free" polyforms because both rotations and reflections are allowed.
%C A384067 The cuboctahedron is the polyhedral dual of the rhombic dodecahedron.

%e A384067 a(1) = 2 because the cuboctahedron is not face-transitive, but has two distinct types of faces: triangular faces and square faces.
%Y A384067 Cf. A333333 (rhombic dodecahedron, row 3).
%Y A384067 Cf. A384067 (cuboctahedron), A384068 (truncated cube), A384069 (truncated octahedron), A384070 (rhombicuboctahedron), A384071 (truncated cuboctahedron), A384072 (snub cube).
