%N A384034 Irregular triangle read by rows. Start with T(1,1) = 1. For each subsequent row, traverse the array so far. For each value m, insert m new values from the next unused integers immediately to the right of m. The process is repeated row by row, where each number in the array dictates how many new values are added after it.
%e A384034 Triangle begins:
%e A384034   1;
%e A384034   1, 2;
%e A384034   1, 3, 2, 4, 5;
%e A384034   1, 6, 3, 7, 8, 9, 2, 10, 11, 4, 12, 13, 14, 15, 5, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20;
%e A384034   ...
%e A384034 Row 1 = [1].
%e A384034 For m = 1, insert 1 new integer (next unused is 2) to the right of 1.
%e A384034 Row 2 = [1, 2].
%e A384034 For m = 1, insert 1 new integer (next unused is 3) to the right of 1.
%e A384034 For m = 2, insert 2 new integers (next unused are 4, 5) to the right of 2.
%e A384034 Row 3 = [1, 3, 2, 4, 5].
%e A384034 For m = 1, insert 1 new integer (6).
%e A384034 For m = 3, insert 3 new integers (7, 8, 9).
%e A384034 For m = 2, insert 2 new integers (10, 11).
%e A384034 For m = 4, insert 4 new integers (12, 13, 14, 15).
%e A384034 For m = 5, insert 5 new integers (16, 17, 18, 19, 20).
%e A384034 Row 4 = [1, 6, 3, 7, 8, 9, 2, 10, 11, 4, 12, 13, 14, 15, 5, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20].
