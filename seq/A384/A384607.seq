%N A384607 Possible values for the number of groups of order equal to a prime power, in order of size.
%C A384607 Possible values of A098885, ordered by size.
%C A384607 This sequence is the same regardless of whether 1 is considered a prime power or not (see A000961 for discussion on this) as A000001(1)=A000001(p)=1 for all p.

%e A384607 1 is in this sequence because A000001(2) = 1.
%e A384607 2 is in this sequence because A000001(2^2) = 2.
%e A384607 5 is in this sequence because A000001(2^3) = 5.
%e A384607 3 is not in this sequence as no prime power p^k has A000001(p^k)=3.
%Y A384607 Cf. A000001, A098885, A384606.
