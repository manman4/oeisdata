%N A244216 Numbers k that are at least twice the size the largest Catalan number less than or equal to k.
%C A244216 Equally: Numbers k such that if m is the largest Catalan number <= k [= A081290(k)], then k >= 2*m.
%C A244216 Numbers k such that the Greedy Catalan Base representation of k (cf. A014418) starts with digit 2 or 3.
