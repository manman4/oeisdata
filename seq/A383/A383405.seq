%N A383405 Partial sums of the sum of the divisors of the numbers of the form 6*k + 5, k >= 0.
%C A383405 Consider a spiral similar to the spiral described in A239660 but instead of having four quadrants on the square grid the new spiral has six wedges on the triangular grid. A "diamond" formed by two adjacent triangles has area 1. a(n) is the total number of diamonds (or the total area) in the fifth wedge after n + 1 turns. The interesting fact is that for n >> 1 the geometric pattern in the fifth wedge of the spiral is very similar to the geometric pattern of the first wedge but it is different from the other wedges. Also the geometric pattern in the second wedge is very similar to the geometric pattern of the fourth wedge. Note that the six wedge spiral shows more and better geometric patterns than the four quadrants spiral.
