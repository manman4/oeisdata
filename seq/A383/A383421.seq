%N A383421 a(1)=1; thereafter if a(n-1) is a first occurrence, then a(n) is the number of values that occur exactly once in the sequence thus far. Otherwise; a(n) is the number of terms that are the same distance away from an earlier equal value as a(n-1) is from its previous last occurrence.

%e A383421 a(18) = 3: a(17) = 1 has a distance of 5 from its previous last occurrence a(12) = 1. There are a total of 3 terms with a distance of 5 from an earlier equal term; they occur at indices i = 8,9,17. So a(18) = 3.
