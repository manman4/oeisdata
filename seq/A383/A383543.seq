%N A383543 a(n) is the largest number k such that i*n + 1 is squarefree for all 0 <= i <= k.
%C A383543 The sums of the first 10^k terms, for k = 1, 2, ..., are 20, 204, 2534, 27314, 282074, 2835574, 28408796, 284149401, 2841591067, 28416151694, ... . Apparently, the asymptotic mean of this sequence is 2.8416..., which seems to be also the asymptotic mean of A383546.
