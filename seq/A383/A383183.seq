%N A383183 Square spiral numbers of the n-th grid point visited by a king always moving to the unvisited point labeled with the smallest possible prime or else composite number.
%C A383183 The infinite 2D grid is labeled along a square spiral as shown in A316328, starting with 0 at the origin (0,0), where the n-th shell contains the 8n points with sup norm n, as follows:

%C A383183 The cursor is moving like a chess king to the von Neumann neighbor not visited earlier and labeled with the smallest prime number if possible, otherwise with the smallest possible composite number.
%C A383183 After the 171th move, the cursor is trapped in the point (3,0) labeled a(171) = 33. All eight neighbors were then already visited earlier, so the king has no more any possible move.

%H A383183 M. F. Hasler, <a href="/A383183/a383183_1.png">Path plot of A383183(0..171)</a>. (The 8 dark blue points around the red ending point represent the 8 already visited neighbors.) May 13, 2025.
%e A383183 From the starting point (0,0) labeled a(0) = 0, the king can reach the point (1,1) labeled 2, which is the smallest possible prime number, so a(1) = 2.
%e A383183 Then the king can reach (1,0) labeled 3 which is the next smaller prime number, so a(2) = 3. From there it can go to (-1,0) labeled 5 = a(3), and then to (0,-1) labeled a(4) 7 = a(4). From there, the only available prime number is 23 = a(5) at (1,-2).
%e A383183 The king continues in that south-east direction, before walking in north-east direction and then back and further south-east up to and beyond the point (10,-10). Then it goes back in the opposite north-west direction up to (-8,7) and (-5, 8), before heading to the point (3,0) where it gets stuck.
