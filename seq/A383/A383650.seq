%N A383650 Averages k of a twin prime pair such that 3*k*2^d is also the average of a twin prime pair for some divisor d of 3*k.
%C A383650 All terms after a(2) are abundant (A005101), this is because all primes greater than 3 are of the form 6*k +- 1, thus the average of twin primes is 6*k, and since any multiple of a perfect or abundant number is abundant itself, it means that this property holds for all n > 11. - _Jakub Buczak_, May 04 2025
%H A383650 Jakub Buczak, <a href="/A383650/b383650.txt">Table of n, a(n) for n = 1..125</a>
%F A383650 a(n) ~ b*n^c for some constants b and c as n tends to infinity (conjectured). - _Jakub Buczak_, May 04 2025
%e A383650 Average 4 of a twin prime pair is in the sequence because 3*4*2^4 = 192 is also the average of twin primes 191 and 193 for divisor d = 4 of 3*k = 3*4 = 12.
