%N A383154 The number of 2n-by-2n fers-wazir tours.
%C A383154 The simplest fairy chess pieces, going back to 9th-century Persia, are the fers -- a (1,1) leaper -- and the wazir -- a (1,0) leaper. (A king combines the moves of a fers and a wazir.) A fers-wazir tour visits every cell of a board exactly once, making fers and wazir moves alternately, and returns to the starting cell.
%C A383154 Such tours exist only when the number of rows is even and the number of columns is even.
