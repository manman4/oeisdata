%N A383984 Number of connected subsets of n edges of the icosidodecahedron up to the 120 rotations and reflections of the icosidodecahedron.
%C A383984 Connected subsets of edges are also called "polysticks," "polyedges," and "polyforms."
%C A383984 These are "free" polyforms, in that two polyforms are equivalent if one can be mapped to the other using the 120 symmetries of the icosidodecahedron.
%Y A383984 Cf. A019988.
