%N A383673 a(n) is the number of n X n Latin squares obeying a certain self-referential property defined in the comments.
%C A383673 a(n) = |B_n| where B_n is the set defined as follows:
%C A383673 Let G be a grid of n X n cells. Then, B_n is the set of all G which satisfy these properties:
%C A383673 0. Each cell g(r, c) of G contains exactly one element from Z_n.
%C A383673 1. G is a Latin square.
%C A383673 Two cells, A = g(a_r, a_c) and B = g(b_r, b_c), form a referential domino iff a_r = g(A, B).
%C A383673 2. If two horizontally adjacent cells A and B are not in the last column, then (A, B) must be a referential domino. Alternatively stated, for all a_r in Z_n and a_c in Z_{n-2}, given the horizontal domino A = g(a_r, a_c) and B = g(a_r, a_c + 1), then g(A, B) = a_r.
%C A383673 Altering the conditions to index the grid from 1 (instead of 0), and filling with integers 1 to n inclusive does not change the number of grids in B_n, nor does it qualitatively change those grids; they are only transformed by a simple relabeling.
%C A383673 a(1) = 1, and a(2) = 2 may be considered degenerate since they are not restricted by property 2.
%C A383673 It appears that if a(n) is nonzero, then n is a prime power.
%C A383673 It appears that n=3 and n=7 are the only prime powers for which a(n) = 0.
%C A383673 a(n) appears to always be even, except a(1) = a(4) = 1.

%e A383673 The following is an example of G in B_5:
%e A383673   ..01234
%e A383673   .......
%e A383673   0.14023
%e A383673   1.32410
%e A383673   2.20341
%e A383673   3.43102
%e A383673   4.01234
%e A383673 Properties 0 and 1 are trivially verifiable.
%e A383673 For property 2, the pair A = g(4,1), B = g(4,2):
%e A383673     is a horizontal domino in row r=4, with neither cell in the last column
%e A383673     is a referential domino, since g(A, B) = g(1, 2) = 4 = r
%e A383673 The same holds for the rest of the dominoes in G.
%e A383673 G' is a grid obtained by swapping  3 <-> 1 and 2 <-> 0 for every cell in G.
%e A383673 G' is also in B_5.
%e A383673 G and G' are the only 2 members of B_5, thus a(5) = 2.
