%N A383461 Number of vertices in graph G_n formed by taking a regular n-gon with all its chords extended to infinity (the n-th graph in A344857) and inverting it in its circumscribing circle.
%C A383461 Inverting a point or a line in a circle C with center O and radius r is a classical operation in geometry (Coxeter, Section 6.3; Pedoe, pp. 4-9). Every point A inside C except O itself has an inverse point A' outside the circle; A' lies on the line OA and satisfies |OA|*|OA'| = r^2. The inverse of the center O is undefined.
%C A383461 If a line L passes through O its inverse is L itself. If L is not a diameter of C, and meets C in two points A and B, the inverse of L is the circle through O, A, and B.
%C A383461 Theorem: G_n has A345025(n) regions. If n is even then n of these regions are infinite, otherwise there is a single infinite region.
%C A383461 The initial versions of the illustrations were made by NJAS using GeoGebra. The colored versions were added later by SRS using a Java program. These have greater resolution and include information about the vertex and region counts.
