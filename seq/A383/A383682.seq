%F A383682 a(n) ~ n^2-2*sqrt(2)*n^(3/2)+O(n^(5/4)) (Reznick 1989, p. 201).
%e A383682 Consider n=3: 3 and 5 can be written as sums of squares of partitions of 3, as 3=1^2+1^2+1^2 and 5=2^2+1^2, but 7 cannot be written as a sum of squares of a partition of 3, so a(3)=5.
%e A383682 Consider n=4: 4, 6, 8, and 10 can be written as sums of squares of partitions of 4, as 4=1^2+1^2+1^2+1^2, 6=2^2+1^2+1^2, 8=2^2+2^2, and 10=3^2+1^2, but 12 cannot be written as a sum of squares of a partition of 4, so a(4)=10.
