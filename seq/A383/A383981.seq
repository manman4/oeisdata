%N A383981 Number of connected subsets of n edges of the rhombic dodecahedron up to the 48 rotations and reflections of the rhombic dodecahedron.
%C A383981 Connected subsets of edges are also called "polysticks," "polyedges," and "polyforms."
%C A383981 These are "free" polyforms, in that two polyforms are equivalent if one can be mapped to the other using the 48 symmetries of the rhombic dodecahedron.
%Y A383981 Cf. A019988.
