%N A383402 Smallest number whose largest odd divisor is its n-th divisor.
%C A383402 From _Peter Munn_, May 15 2025 and May 20 2025: (Start)
%C A383402 A038547 is easily seen to be an upper bound for the sequence and a term equals this upper bound if and only if it is odd. Moreover, if a(n) = 2m with m odd, then the largest odd divisor of 2m is m, its second largest divisor, and a(n) = 2 * A038547((n+1)/2). It follows that 1 is the only term not divisible by 4 or by a nonunit term of A038547.
%C A383402 a(8) = 105 is the last squarefree term. (This is a corollary to lemma: prime p > 9 cannot be a divisor of a squarefree term. Proof of lemma: Let p divide squarefree k. If 3p is also divisor, set m = 9k/p, otherwise set m = 3k/p. Then k is not a term as m is a smaller number whose largest odd divisor is in the same position in the divisor list.)
%C A383402 (End)
%C A383402 If a(n) = m then m has at least n divisors. - _David A. Corneth_, May 16 2025
%C A383402 Every term a(n) = t > 1 is divisible by 2 or 3. Proof: Suppose it is not. Then it is odd and n is the number of divisors of t (cf. A000005). But t is not the smallest number that has n odd divisors that is odd. Setting every prime factor p to the largest prime < p and then multiplying gives a smaller odd number that has n divisors (cf. A064989). - _David A. Corneth_, May 17 2025

%e A383402 The divisors of 18 are [1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18] and the largest odd divisor is 9 and 9 is its 5th divisor, so a(5) = 18 because 18 the smallest number having that property.
