%C A383391 If it exists then it is at least sqrt(A002110(24)/2 * 155925 + 1) - 1 ~= 4.3*10^19.
%C A383391 Proof: Exactly two of k, k+1, k+2 and k+3 are odd. Those two are coprime and differ by 2. Let them be m and m+2. Then sigma(m) > 2*m and sigma(m+2) > 2*(m+2). As they are coprime we have sigma(m*(m+2)) > 2*m*2*(m+2) so for a lower bound we look for the smallest odd t that sigma(t) > 4*t. The partial product of p / (p-1) for odd primes p first exceeds 4 when odd primes <= 79 are multiplied so t is divisible by 3 * 5 * 7 * ... * 79. A small search of multiples of this number gives A002110(24)/2 * 155925.
%C A383391 k * (k + 2) >= A002110(24)/2 * 155925 so k * (k + 2) + 1 = (k + 1)^2 >= A002110(24)/2 * 155925 + 1. Taking square roots on both sides and keeping the positive root gives the desired lower bound. (End)

%C A383391 Both types of numbers exist, but the constructed ones are too large to be displayed here. For numbers k such that k^2, (k+1)^2, (k+2)^2 and (k+3)^2 are all abundant numbers, choose 4 disjoint subsets of the primes P_1, P_2, P_3 and P_4, and let the product of elements in P_i divide k+i-1. This is achievable because of the Chinese remainder theorem. If P_i contains p_1, ..., p_k, then sigma((k+i-1)^2)/(k+i-1)^2 >= Product_{i=1..k} (p_i+1)/p_i.
%C A383391 We are able to make the right hand side larger than 2 for each i because the infinite product Product_{p is prime} (p+1)/p = Product_{p is prime} (1+1/p) = Sum_{k is squarefree} 1/k diverges, since the squarefree numbers have asymptotic density 6/Pi^2.
%C A383391 For odd terms in this sequence, we can use only the odd primes to construct 3 prime subsets instead, and add a constraint that k == 1 (mod 2) after which the Chinese remainder theorem still applies. (End)
