%N A383082 The number of distinct straightedge-and-compass constructions that can be made with a total of n lines and circles.
%C A383082 A straightedge-and-compass construction starts with 2 points marked on the plane, traditionally (0,0) and (1,0). One can use a straightedge to draw a line between two marked points or a compass to draw a circle centered at a marked point through another marked point.
%C A383082 New points occur at the intersections of lines or circles with lines or circles.
%C A383082 Constructions are considered distinct if the location of the lines, circles, and points is different. In particular, a translation of a construction is considered distinct. - _Peter Kagey_, May 07 2025

%e A383082 For n = 0, the a(0) = 1 diagram is the one consisting of two points.
%e A383082 For n = 1, there are a(1) = 3 possible constructions:
%e A383082 1) a line between (0,0), and (1,0),
%e A383082 2) a circle of radius 1 centered at (0,0),
%e A383082 3) a circle of radius 1 centered at (1,0).
%e A383082 For n = 2, there are a(2) = 3 possible constructions:
%e A383082 1) a line between (0,0), and (1,0) and a circle of radius 1 centered at (0,0), which marks the point (-1,0);
%e A383082 2) a line between (0,0), and (1,0) and a circle of radius 1 centered at (1,0), which marks the point (2,0);
%e A383082 3) two circles, both of radius 1, centered at (0,0) and (1,0), which marks the points (1/2,sqrt(3/4)) and (1/2,-sqrt(3/4)).
