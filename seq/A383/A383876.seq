%N A383876 a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1. Let n be greatest index such that a(0),...a(n) are already known. If a(n) is not a record term, a(n+1) = number of k < n such that a(k) = a(n). If a(n) is a record term a(n+1) = a(r) where r is the greatest record < a(n).
%C A383876 After a(5) = 2 a record term produces a string of familiar terms leading to the next record, whereupon the process repeats (see Example). Since each record term increments its predecessor by +1, the records subsequence is A001477. If the first condition in Name is replaced by the "count back" function of A181391 the result is A025480 (n >= 1). The proper subsequence a(r), r a record = 0,1,2,3,..... is identical to the original, therefore the sequence contains infinitely many proper copies of itself. Every nonnegative integer appears infinitely many times.

%e A383876 a(1) = 1 is a record term so a(2) = a(0) = 0 since 0 is the greatest record prior to 1. a(2) = 0, which has been seen once already so a(3) = 1, which has also been seen once already so a(4) = 1. Now there are two prior terms = 1, so a(5) = 2, and since this is a new record, a(6) = a(1) since 1 is the greatest record prior to 2. Therefore a(6) = 1. Now 1 has occurred 3 times prior to a(6) so a(7) = 3. The number of repeat terms between consecutive records varies, starting: 0,3,1,3,1,1..
