%N A383966 Numbers k such that floor(2^k / 5) is a prime.
%C A383966 From _David A. Corneth_, Jun 07 2025: (Start)
%C A383966 Observation from Hugo Pfoertner: For k > 4, terms are equivalent to 3 (mod 4).
%C A383966 Proof: We may write 2^k = 2^(4*m + r) = 16^m * 2^r = (15 + 1)^m * 2^r with 0 <= r <= 3.
%C A383966 Floor dividing by 5 gives 3*t + floor(2^r) for some positive integer t. floor(2^r) = 0 for r in {0, 1, 2} so then floor(2^k) is a multiple of 3. For k > 4 and r < 3 we definitely do get a multiple of 3 that is larger than 3 hence composite. (End)

%e A383966 From _David A. Corneth_, Jun 07 2025: (Start)
%e A383966 4 is in the sequence as floor(2^4/5) = 3 is prime.
%e A383966 5 is not in the sequence as floor(2^5/5) = 6 which is not prime.
%e A383966 7 is not in the sequence as floor(2^7/5) = 25 is not prime.
%e A383966 8 is not in the sequence as 8 > 4 and 8 is not equivalent to 3 (mod 4).
%e A383966 11 is in the sequence as floor(2^11/5) = 409 which is prime. (End)
