%N A383744 The number of distinct straightedge-and-compass constructions that can be made with a total of n lines and circles up to rigid motion.
%C A383744 A straightedge-and-compass construction starts with 2 points marked on the plane, traditionally (0,0) and (1,0). One can use a straightedge to draw a line between two marked points or a compass to draw a circle centered at a marked point through another marked point. New points occur at the intersections of lines or circles with lines or circles.
%C A383744 In this sequence, two constructions are considered the same if you can rotate, reflect, or translate one to get the other.

%e A383744 For example the following two constructions are considered the same:
%e A383744 (1) Draw a circle centered at (0,0) through (1,0), and then draw a line through (0,0) and (1,0).
%e A383744 (2) Draw a line through (0,0) and (0,1) and then draw a circle centered at (1,0) through (0,0).
