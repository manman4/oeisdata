%N A383020 G(n) is a graph constructed with nodes labelled with integers n through n+a(n). Edges are drawn between consecutive integers and between integers sharing the same largest prime factor. a(n) is the smallest integer for which G(n) is not planar.

%F A383020 a(n) >= a(n-1) - 1. - _Pontus von Brömssen_, Apr 22 2025
%e A383020 a(2) = 8: the graph G(2) has nodes labelled 2-10. Consecutive integers are connected by an edge. Also pairwise connected are: 3, 6, and 9 because they have 3 as the largest prime factor; 2, 4, and 8 because they have 2 as the largest prime factor; 5 and 10 because they have 5 as the largest prime factor. Nodes 2 and 10 are not connected because although 2 is a prime factor of 10, it is not the largest prime factor. This graph is non-planar. a(2) is larger than 7 because the nodes 2-9 make a planar graph. So a(2) = 8.
