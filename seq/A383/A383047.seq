%N A383047 Squarefree d such that x^3+y^3=z^3 has non-trivial solution in Q(sqrt(d)).
%C A383047 Equivalent condition is that the elliptic curve dY^2=X^3-432 has positive rank.
%C A383047 Under the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture, d not divisible by 3 appears in this sequence if and only if x^2 + y^2 + 7z^2 + xz = d and x^2 + 2y^2 + 4z^2 + xy + yz = d have equal numbers of integral solutions, and d divisible by 3 appears in this sequence if and only if x^2 + 3y^2 + 27z^2 = d/3 and 3x^2 + 4y^2 + 7z^2 - 2yz = d/3 have equal numbers of integral solutions.
%C A383047 For d not divisible by 3, d appears in this sequence if and only if 3d appears in A383048, and 3d appears in this sequence if and only if d appears in A383048.
