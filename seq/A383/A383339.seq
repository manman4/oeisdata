%N A383339 a(1)=1; thereafter if a(n-1) is a first occurrence, then a(n) is the number of first occurrences in the sequence thus far. Otherwise; a(n) is the number of terms that are the same distance away from their previous last occurrence as a(n-1).
%C A383339 Alternatively, a(n) is the number of terms with the same Backwards van Eck transform as a(n-1).

%e A383339 a(14) = 5: a(13) = 2 has a distance of 1 from its previous last occurrence a(12) = 2. There are 5 terms in total with a distance of 1 from their previous last occurrence; they are at indices i = 2,3,6,10,13. So a(14) = 5.
