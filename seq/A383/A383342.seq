%N A383342 Lexicographically earliest infinite sequence of distinct positive integers such that the number following any consecutive pair x, y of terms is the smallest novel number divisible by R(x,y) = rad(x*y)/rad(gcd(x,y)).
%C A383342 For numbers x, y let f(x) = {prime p: p|x} and f(y) = {prime q: q|y} be the sets of distinct prime factors of x and y respectively, then R(x,y) is the product of the primes which occur once only in the union of f(x) and f(y). There are two conditions for entry of a prime following adjacent terms x, y: (i). rad(x) = rad(y) implies that the next term is the smallest number not yet seen in the sequence (which could be prime); (ii). rad(x) = A002110(k), rad(y) = A002110(k)/prime(m), m <= k implies prime(m). After computation of 2^24 terms the only primes found are 2,3,5,7. Furthermore in the same data range, if a given composite squarefree number k appears there seems no guarantee that all numbers m with rad(m) = rad(k) will also appear (a(5) = 6 and subsequently we see only 12 and 18; a(9) = 10 and thereafter we see only 20,40,50,80,100). Also the primorial numbers do not appear in order (e.g. A002110(11) appears before A002110(10)).

%e A383342 It follows from the definition that the first two terms must be a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2. R(1,2) = rad(2)/rad(1) = 2 and since 2 is already a term, a(3) = 4.
%e A383342 Since a(2) = 2 and a(3) = 4 have the same rad it follows that a(4) = 3, the smallest novel number.
%e A383342 R(4,3) = rad(12)/rad(1) = 6, so a(5) = 6, since 6 has not occurred earlier.
%e A383342 R(3,6) = rad(18)/rad(3) = 2, so a(6) = 8, the least novel multiple of 2.
%e A383342 R(6,8) = rad(48)/rad(2) = 6/2 = 3 so a(7) = 9, the least novel multiple of 3.
%e A383342 a(23) = 126, a(24) = 210 and R(126,210) = rad(126*210)/rad(42) = 210/42 = 5, which has not occurred earlier, so a(25) = 5.
