%N A383731 Number of hexagonal n-element polyominoes whose graph is a nonextensible path.
%C A383731 A 2-sided strip polyhex is a shape formed by a set of connected cells on a hexagonal grid, all cells having exactly two neighbors except for the first and last cell, which have only one neighbor. The shape is considered identical to its mirror image, as well as any translation or rotation of itself. This sequence counts the number of 2-sided strip polyhexes with n cells to which no additional cell can be added without introducing a branch or cycle. See also illustration.
