%N A383336 Smallest number with shortest addition-multiplication-exponentiation chain of length n.
%C A383336 For n >= 1, the largest number with shortest addition-multiplication-exponentiation chain of length n is A173566(n).
%e A383336 a(7) = 79 because all smaller numbers have addition-multiplication-exponentiation chains of length at most 6, but the shortest chain for 79 has length 7. One such chain is (1, 2, 3, 5, 32, 37, 42, 79). (There are also such chains that do not use exponentiation, such as (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 15, 75, 79).)
