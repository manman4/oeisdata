%N A383169 Triangle T(n,k) read by rows: For closed chains of j identical regular polygons with connecting inner vertices lying n vertices apart, the n-th row lists the possible j in descending order; n>=0, 1<=k<=d(8+4n).
%C A383169 Consider j identical regular m-gons, assembled into a circular closed chain. Two neighboring polygons share an edge and two vertices, the "inner" one lying in the interior of the chain. The interior is a j-pointed star with equal edges.
%C A383169 n is introduced in order to partition the set of chains into finite subsets. Two neighboring star points are separated by n vertices; there the star has reflex angles. (With n=0, regular polygons are considered as stars with no reflex angles.)
%C A383169 For every j > 2 there exists a chain with exactly j polygons.
%C A383169 A366872 gives the number of row elements.
%C A383169 The descending order in the definition was chosen with respect to the interconnection with A383168. For each n there are finitely many pairs (m,j) for j m-gons building closed chains. j are given by T(n,k) and the corresponding m are given by A383168(n,k).
%C A383169 m = 4 + 2n + (8+4n)/(j-2).
%C A383169 j = 2 + (8+4n)/(m-4-2n).
%C A383169 These two equations allow a computation of T(n,k) and A383168(n,k) from each other, see Formula.
