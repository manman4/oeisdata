%N A383983 Number of connected subsets of n edges of the rhombic triacontahedron up to the 120 rotations and reflections of the rhombic triacontahedron.
%C A383983 Connected subsets of edges are also called "polysticks," "polyedges," and "polyforms."
%C A383983 These are "free" polyforms, in that two polyforms are equivalent if one can be mapped to the other using the 120 symmetries of the rhombic triacontahedron.
%Y A383983 Cf. A019988.
