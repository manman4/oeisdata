%N A383618 Smallest prime gap whose first occurrence is >= 2^n.
%C A383618 In the case of a prime gap that straddles a power of 2, we take the lower end of the gap, as listed in A000230.

%e A383618 a(3) = 6, because prime gaps of 1, 2, and 4 all appear before 2^3 = 8, but a prime gap of 6 does not occur until later.
%Y A383618 Cf. A000230.
