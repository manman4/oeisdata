%N A383067 The set of positive integers k which can be expressed as a sum of two units in some cyclic cubic field.
%C A383067 These are all the positive integers k such that there exists some cubic number field K whose Galois group is cyclic (C_3) and contains units u, v in K such that k = u + v.

%e A383067 For each positive integer k given in the sequence, it can be written as a sum of two units in some cyclic cubic field as follows:
%e A383067 1 = u + (-u+1), where u is a root of x^3 + x^2 - 2x - 1.
%e A383067 2 = u + (-u+2), where u is a root of x^3 - 3x - 1.
%e A383067 3 = (u^2) + (-u^2+3), where u is a root of x^3 + x^2 - 2x - 1.
%e A383067 4 = (u^2+2u) + (-u^2-2u+4), where u is a root of x^3 + x^2 - 2x - 1.
%e A383067 5 = (u^2-u) + (-u^2+u+5), where u is a root of x^3 + x^2 - 2x - 1.
%e A383067 7 = (u^2) + (-u^2+7), where u is a root of x^3 - x^2 - 4x - 1.
%e A383067 19 = (5u^2+9u) + (-5u^2-9u+19), where u is a root of x^3 + x^2 - 2x - 1.
%e A383067 22 = (4u^2-5u) + (-4u^2+5u+22), where u is a root of x^3 + x^2 - 2x - 1.
