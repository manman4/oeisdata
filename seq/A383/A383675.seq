%N A383675 Number of n-digit terms in A157711.
%C A383675 The b-file terms are based on probable prime counts that have been verified correct (by counting proven primes) to index 200. Subsequent terms (as they get larger) seemingly face an increasing probability of counting a probable prime that is actually a composite but it is unknown if such probability is ever large enough to impact the intended proven prime count.
