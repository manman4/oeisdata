%N A383025 Centered pentagonal numbers that are deficient.
%C A383025 The centered pentagonal numbers that are prime are terms (see A145838).
%H A383025 Robert Israel, <a href="/A383025/b383025.txt">Table of n, a(n) for n = 1..10000</a>
%F A383025 a(n) == 1 (mod 5).
%e A383025 16 = 2^4 is a term since it is the 3rd centered pentagonal number and larger than the sum of its proper divisors (1+2+4+8=15).
%e A383025 51 = 3*17 is a term since it is the 5th centered pentagonal number and larger than the sum of its proper divisors (1+3+17=21).
%e A383025 76 = 2^2*19 is a term since it is the 6th centered pentagonal number and larger than the sum of its proper divisors (1+2+4+19+38=64).
