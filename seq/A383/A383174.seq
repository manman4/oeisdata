%N A383174 Permutation of the natural numbers formed by ordering by max(gpfi,bigomega), then bigomega, then numerically, where gpfi(k) = A061395(k) and bigomega(k) = A001222(k).
%C A383174 The sequence can be constructed starting with term 1 and then:
%C A383174 At step number m >= 1, append terms k with gpfi(k) <= m and bigomega(k) <= m, and which have not already appeared, and ordered first by bigomega and then numerically.
%C A383174 Terms which have not appeared are exactly those with gpfi(k) = m or bigomega(k) = m, and in particular they start with prime(m) and end with prime(m)^m.
%C A383174 First differs from A344844 at n=30, with its ordering by prime exponents differing from here ordering numerically. - _Michael S. Branicky_, Apr 20 2025
