%N A383403 Partial sums of the sum of the divisors of the numbers of the form 6*k + 3, k >= 0.
%C A383403 Partial sums of the sum of the divisors of A016945.
%C A383403 See the illustration of a(3) and a(10) as the total area (or total number of cells) in the diagram of the symmetric representation of sigma in the Links section.
%C A383403 Also consider a spiral similar to the spiral described in A239660 but with six wedges on the triangular grid. A "diamond" formed by two adjacent triangles has area 1. a(n) is the total number of diamonds (or the total area) in the third wedge after n + 1 turns. The spiral can be visualized from the top view of the stepped pyramid described in A274536. The graph is named W3 in the Plot 6 of the Links section.

%e A383403 For n = 3 the first four terms of the numbers of the form 6*k + 3, k >= 0, are [3, 9, 15, 21]. The divisors of them are [1, 3], [1, 3, 9], [1, 3, 5, 15], [1, 3, 7, 21]. The sum of the divisors of them are [4, 13, 24, 32] respectively, and the sum of all divisors of them are 4 + 13 + 24 + 32 = 73, so a(3) = 73.
