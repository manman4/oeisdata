%N A383363 Composite numbers k all of whose proper divisors have binary weights that are not equal to the binary weight of k.
%C A383363 First differs from A325571 at n = 56: A325571(56) = 267 is not a term of this sequence. Differs from A325571 by having the terms 16849, 35235, 101265, 268357, 295717, ..., and not having the terms 267, 295, 327, 387, 395, ... .
%C A383363 Composite numbers k such that A380844(k) = 1.
%C A383363 All the odd primes p have A380844(p) = 1.
%C A383363 All the terms are odd numbers since for an even number k, A000120(k) = A000120(k/2).
