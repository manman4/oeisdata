%N A161830 Y-toothpick triangle (see Comments lines for definition).
%C A161830 Y-toothpick sequence starting at the corner of an infinite hexagon in which its vertex touch an endpoint of the initial Y-toothpick and the two other endpoints are equidistant from the nearest sides of the hexagon.
%C A161830 The sequence gives the number of Y-toothpicks in the structure after n rounds. A161831 (the first differences) gives the number added at the n-th round.
%C A161830 See the Y-toothpick sequence A160120 for more information about the recursive, fractal-like structure.
