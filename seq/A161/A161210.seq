%N A161210 Toothpick sequence starting at the outside corner of an infinite cube from which protrudes a half toothpick.
%C A161210 The sequence gives the number of toothpicks after n rounds. A161211 (the first differences) gives the number added at the n-th round.
%C A161210 This structure is a three-dimensional version of the toothpick structure of A153006.
%C A161210 Toothpicks are placed following a rotation of axes: x,y,z,x,y,z,... and so on.
%C A161210 See A139250 and A160160 for more information about the toothpick sequences.
