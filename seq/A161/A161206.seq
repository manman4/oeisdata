%N A161206 V-toothpick (or honeycomb) sequence (see Comments lines for definition).
%C A161206 A V-toothpick is constructed from two toothpicks of length 1 with a 120-degree angle between them, forming a V.
%C A161206 On the infinite hexagonal grid, we start at round 0 with no V-toothpicks.
%C A161206 At round 1 we place a V-toothpick anywhere in the plane.
%C A161206 At round 2 we place two other V-toothpicks. Note that, after round 2, in the structure there are three V-toothpicks, with seven 120-degree angles and one 240-degree angle.
%C A161206 At round 3 we place four other V-toothpicks.
%C A161206 And so on...
%C A161206 The structure looks like an unfinished honeycomb.
%C A161206 The sequence gives the number of V-toothpicks after n rounds. A161207 (the first differences) gives the number added at the n-th round.
%C A161206 See the entry A139250 for more information about the growth of toothpicks.
%C A161206 Note that, on the infinite hexagonal grid, a V-toothpick can be represented as a polyedge with two components. In this case, at n-th round, the structure is a polyedge with 2*a(n) components (or 2*a(n) toothpicks).
%C A161206 In the structure we can see distinct closed polygonal regions with side length equal to 1, for example: regular hexagons, concave decagons, concave dodecagons.
