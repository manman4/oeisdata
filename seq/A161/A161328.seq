%N A161328 E-toothpick sequence (see Comments lines for definition).
%C A161328 An E-toothpick is formed by three toothpicks, as an trident. The E-toothpick has a midpoint and three exposed endpoints such that the distance between the endpoint of the central toothpick and the endpoints of the other toothpicks is equal to 1.
%C A161328 On the infinite triangular grid, we start at round 0 with no E-toothpicks.
%C A161328 At round 1 we place an E-toothpick anywhere in the plane.
%C A161328 At round 2 we add three more E-toothpicks.
%C A161328 At round 3 we add five more E-toothpicks.
%C A161328 And so on... (see illustrations).
%C A161328 The rule for adding new E-toothpicks is as follows. Each E has three ends, which initially are free. If the ends of two E's meet, those ends are no longer free. To go from round n to round n+1, we add an E-toothpick at each free end (extending that end in the direction it is pointing), subject to the condition that no end of any new E can touch any end of an existing E from round n or earlier. (Two new E's are allowed to touch.)
%C A161328 The sequence gives the number of E-toothpicks in the structure after n rounds. A161329 (the first differences) gives the number added at the n-th round.
%C A161328 Note that, on the infinite triangular grid, a E-toothpick can be represented as a polyedge with three components. In this case, at n-th round, the structure is a polyedge with 3*a(n) components. See the entry A139250 for more information about the growth of the toothpicks.
%C A161328 See also the snowflake sequence A161330.
