%N A161910 Y-toothpick sequence starting at the corner of an infinite hexagon from which protrudes a half toothpick with an angle = Pi/6.
%C A161910 The sequence gives the number of Y-toothpicks in the structure after n rounds. A160123 (the first differences) gives the number added at the n-th round.
%C A161910 See the entries A160120, A161830 and A161426 for more information about Y-toothpick sequences.
