%N A161896 Integers m such that (9^m - 3 * 3^m - 4*m) / (2*m * (2*m + 1)) is an integer.
%C A161896 Near superset of the Sophie Germain primes (A005384), excluding 2 and 3: 2n + 1 is prime. Nearly all members of this sequence are also prime, but four members less than 10000 are composite: 1541 = 23 * 67, 2465 = 5 * 17 * 29, 3281 = 17 * 193, and 4961 = 11^2 * 41.
%C A161896 The congruence of n modulo 4 is evenly distributed between 1 and 3. n is congruent to 5 (mod 6) for all n less than two billion.
%C A161896 This sequence has roughly twice the density of the sequence (A158034) corresponding to the Diophantine equation f = (4^n - 2^n + 8n^2 - 2) / (2n * (2n + 1)), and contains most members of that sequence. Those it does not contain are composite and often congruent to 3 (mod 6).
%C A161896 Composite terms appear to predominantly belong to A262051. - _Bill McEachen_, Aug 29 2024
