%N A161412 V-toothpick sequence starting at the corner of an infinite square from which protrudes a half toothpick with an angle = Pi/6.
%C A161412 The sequence gives the number of V-toothpicks in the structure after n rounds. A161413 (the first differences) gives the number added at the n-th round.
