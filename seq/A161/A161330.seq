%N A161330 Snowflake (or E-toothpick) sequence (see Comments lines for definition).
%C A161330 This sequence is an E-toothpick sequence (cf. A161328) but starting with two back-to-back E-toothpicks.
%C A161330 On the infinite triangular grid, we start at round 0 with no E-toothpicks.
%C A161330 At round 1 we place two back-to-back E-toothpicks, forming a star with six endpoints.
%C A161330 At round 2 we add six more E-toothpicks.
%C A161330 At round 3 we add six more E-toothpicks.
%C A161330 And so on ... (see the illustrations).
%C A161330 The rule for adding new E-toothpicks is as follows. Each E has three ends, which initially are free. If the ends of two E's meet, those ends are no longer free. To go from round n to round n+1, we add an E-toothpick at each free end (extending that end in the direction it is pointing), subject to the condition that no end of any new E can touch any end of an existing E from round n or earlier. (Two new E's are allowed to touch.)
%C A161330 The sequence gives the number of E-toothpicks in the structure after n rounds. A161331 (the first differences) gives the number added at the n-th round.
%C A161330 See the entry A139250 for more information about the toothpick process and the toothpick propagation.
%C A161330 Note that, on the infinite triangular grid, a E-toothpick can be represented as a polyedge with three components. In this case, at n-th round, the structure is a polyedge with 3*a(n) components.
