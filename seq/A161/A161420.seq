%N A161420 V-toothpick sequence starting from a V-toothpick whose central point touch a straight line, as a V.
%C A161420 The sequence gives the number of V-toothpicks after n-th stages on hexagonal net. A161421 (the first differences) gives the number added at the n-th stage. See A161206 for more information.
%C A161420 Also, it appears this is a H-toothpick sequence in the first quadrant on the square grid, starting with a D-toothpick from the point (0,0). The sequence gives the number of toothpicks and D-toothpicks after n-th stage. A161421 (the first differences) gives the number added at the n-th stage. For more information see A182838.
