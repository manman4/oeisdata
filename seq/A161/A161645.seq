%N A161645 First differences of A161644: number of new ON cells at generation n of the triangular cellular automaton described in A161644.
%C A161645 See the comments in A161644.
%C A161645 It appears that a(n) is also the number of V-toothpicks or Y-toothpicks added at the n-th stage in a toothpick structure on hexagonal net, starting with a single Y-toothpick in stage 1 and adding only V-toothpicks in stages >=2 (see A161206, A160120, A182633). - _Omar E. Pol_, Dec 07 2010
