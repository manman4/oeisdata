%N A161198 Triangle of polynomial coefficients related to the series expansions of (1-x)^((-1-2*n)/2).
%C A161198 The series expansion of (1-x)^((-1-2*n)/2) = sum(b(p)*x^p, p=0..infinity) for n = 0, 1, 2, .. can be described with b(p) = (F(p,n)/ (2*n-1)!!)*(binomial(2*p,p)/4^(p)) with F(x,n) = 2^n * product( x+(2*k-1)/2, k=1..n). The roots of the F(x,n) polynomials can be found at p = (1-2*k)/2 with k from 1 to n for n = 0, 1, 2, .. . The coefficients of the F(x,n) polynomials lead to the triangle given above. The triangle row sums lead to A001147.
%C A161198 Quite surprisingly we discovered that sum(b(p)*x^p, p=0..infinity) = (1-x)^(-1-2*n)/2, for n = -1, -2, .. . We assume that if m = n+1 then the value returned for product(f(k), k = m..n) is 1 and if m> n+1 then 1/product(f(k), k=n+1..m-1) is the value returned. Furthermore (1-2*n)!! = (-1)^(n+1)/(2*n-3)!! for n = 1, 2, 3 .. . This leads to b(p) = ((-1-2*n)!!/ G(p,n))*(binomial(2*p,p) /4^(p)) for n = -1, -2, .. . For the G(p,n) polynomials we found that G(p,n) = F(-p,-n). The roots of the G(p,n) polynomials can be found at p=(2*k-1)/2 with k from 1 to (-n) for n = -1, -2, .. . The coefficients of the G(p,n) polynomials lead to a second triangle that stands with its head on top of the first one. It is remarkable that the row sums lead once again to A001147.
%C A161198 These two triangles together look like an hourglass so we propose to call the F(p,n) and the G(p,n) polynomials the hourglass polynomials.

%F A161198 a(n,m) := coeff(2^(n)*product((x+(2*k-1)/2),k=1..n), x, m) for n = 0, 1, .. ; m = 0, 1, .. .
%F A161198 a(n, m) = 2*a(n-1,m-1)+(2*n-1)*a(n-1,m) with a(n, n) = 2^n and a(n, 0) = (2*n-1)!!.
%F A161198 a(n,m) = the (m+1)-th term in the top row of M^n, where M is an infinite square production matrix; M[i,j] = A029635(i,j-1) = binomial(i, j-1) + binomial(i-1, j-2) with A029635 the (1.2)-Pascal triangle, see the examples and second Maple program. [_Gary W. Adamson_, Jul 19 2011]
