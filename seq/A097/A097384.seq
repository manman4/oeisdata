%N A097384 Total number of comparisons to find each of the values 1 through n using a binary search with 3-way comparisons (less than, equal and greater than), always choosing the mid-most value to compare to.
%C A097384 Pure binary search with equality.

%F A097384 n + a_{floor((n-1)/2)} + a_{ceiling((n-1)/2)}.
%e A097384 a_5 = 9 = 5 + a_2 + a_2; this is the smallest example where choosing the middle value is not optimal.
%Y A097384 See A097383 for the sequence with an optimized binary search. A003314 is the sequence with only 2-way comparisons.
