%N A154449 Signature permutation of a Catalan bijection induced by generator "a" of the rightward recursing instance of Basilica group wreath recursion: a = (1,b), b = s(1,a).
%C A154449 This automorphism of rooted plane binary trees switches the two descendant trees for every other vertex as it returns back toward the root, after descending down to the rightmost tip of the tree along the 111... ray, so that the last vertex whose descendants are swapped, is the right-hand side child of the root and the root itself is fixed. Specifically, *A154449 = psi(A154439), where the isomorphism psi is given in A153141 (see further comments there).
