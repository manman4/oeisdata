%N A154453 Signature permutation of a Catalan bijection induced by generator "a" of the leftward recursing instance of Basilica group wreath recursion: a = (b,1), b = s(a,1).
%C A154453 This automorphism of rooted plane binary trees switches the two descendant trees for every other vertex as it returns back toward the root, after descending down to the leftmost tip of the tree along the 000... ray, so that the last vertex whose descendants are swapped, is the left-hand side child of the root and the root itself is fixed. Specifically, *A154453 = psi(A154443), where the isomorphism psi is given in A153141 (see further comments there).
