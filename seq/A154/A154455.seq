%N A154455 Signature permutation of a Catalan bijection induced by generator "b" of the leftward recursing instance of Basilica group wreath recursion: a = (b,1), b = s(a,1).
%C A154455 This automorphism of rooted plane binary trees switches the two descendant trees for every other vertex as it returns back toward the root, after descending down to the leftmost tip of the tree along the 000... ray, so that the last vertex whose descendants are swapped is the root node of the tree. Specifically, *A154455 = psi(A154445), where the isomorphism psi is given in A153141 (see further comments there).

%Y A154455 Inverse: A154456. a(n) = A154449(A069767(n)) = A057163(A154451(A057163(n))). Cf. A069770, A154453.
%Y A154455 Differs from A082345 for the first time at n=49, where a(49)=26, while A082345(49)=27. Differs from A122327 for the first time at n=26, where a(26)=49, while A122327(26)=50. Differs from A129612 for the first time at n=195, where a(195)=92, while A129612(195)=91.
