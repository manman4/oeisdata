%N A154441 Permutation of nonnegative integers induced by Basilica group generating wreath recursion: a = (1,b), b = s(1,a), starting from the active (swapping) state b.
%C A154441 This permutation is induced by the Basilica group generating wreath recursion a = (1,b), b = s(1,a) (i.e. binary transducer, where s means that the bits at that state are toggled: 0 <-> 1) given on the page 40 of Bartholdi and Virag paper, starting from the active (switching) state b and rewriting bits from the second most significant bit to the least significant end.

%e A154441 Starting from the second most significant bit, we continue complementing every second bit (in this case, starting from the second most significant bit), as long as the first zero is encountered, which is also complemented if its distance to the most significant bit is odd, after which the remaining bits are left intact. E.g. 121 = 1111001 in binary. Complementing its second and fourth most significant bits (positions 5 & 3) and stopping at the first zero-bit at position 2 (which is not complemented, as its distance to the msb is 6), we obtain "10100.." after which the rest of the bits stay same, so we get 1010001, which is 81's binary representation, thus a(121)=81. On the other hand, 125 = 1111101 in binary and the transducer complements the bits at positions 5, 3 and also the first zero at the position 1 (because at odd distance from the msb), yielding 101011., after which the remaining bit stays same, thus we get 1010111, which is 87's binary representation, thus a(125)=87.
