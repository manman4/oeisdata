%N A334876 Numbers m with the property that sigma(2^m+1)/(2^m+1) > sigma(2^k+1)/(2^k+1) for all k < m, where sigma is the sum of divisors function, A000203.
%C A334876 Set h(m) = sigma(m)/m. Then the sequence lists the numbers m at which record values of h(2^m+1) occur. This sequence is essentially defined similarly to A004394 but restricted to looking just at numbers which are one more than a power of 2.
%C A334876 The sequence is infinite. This can be proved by seeing that we can make h(2^m+1) arbitrarily large. Note that if p is a prime which is 3 (mod 8), then p|2^m+1 for any odd m such that (p-1)/2|m. By the strong version of Dirichlet's theorem the sum of the reciprocals of the primes which are 3 (mod 8) diverges. So we can make h(2^m+1) arbitrarily large by taking m as the largest odd divisor of k! for large k.
%C A334876 It appears that every term in the sequence is odd. This seems likely to be true since if m is even then 2^m+1 is not divisible by 3, which makes it much harder to make h(2^m+1) large.
