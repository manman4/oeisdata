%N A334270 Number of sequences of length n that cover an initial interval of positive integers and are both a reversed Lyndon word and a co-Lyndon word.
%C A334270 Also the number of sequences of length n that cover an initial interval of positive integers and are both a Lyndon word and a reversed co-Lyndon word.
%C A334270 A Lyndon word is a finite sequence of positive integers that is lexicographically strictly less than all of its cyclic rotations. Co-Lyndon is defined similarly, except with strictly greater instead of strictly less.
