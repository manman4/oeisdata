%e A375818 a(1) = 2, as there exists an elliptic curve over Q with good reduction away from 2, e.g. E : y^2 = x^3 + x.
%e A375818 a(2) = 3, as there exists an elliptic curve over Q with good reduction away from 3, e.g. E : y^2 + y = x^3.
%e A375818 a(3) = 7, as there exists an elliptic curve over Q with good reduction away from 7, e.g. E : y^2 + xy = x^3 - x^2 - 2x - 1, but there does not exist an elliptic curve over Q with good reduction away from 5.
