%N A185279 a(n) = number of ways that one can write n as the sum of two positive integers such that i) the integers are relatively prime to n but ii) the integers are not themselves prime.
%C A185279 These might be called "relative Goldbach partitions."
%C A185279 This sequence was first discovered by my student Houston Hutchinson.
%C A185279 We became interested in this sequence when looking at Goldbach Partitions thus at first we only considered the even numbered terms.  The graph of the even values of a(n) looks like Goldbach's comet except with an exponential appearance rather than a logarithmic appearance.  We give a formula for the even values in the formula section.
%C A185279 Sequence A141095 has the terms for even n.

%F A185279 For even n >= 4, denote the number of Goldbach partitions that have distinct primes by g(n), denote the totient of n by t(n), and denote the primes less than n that are NOT factors of n by p(n). Then a(n) = g(n)- p(n) + t(n)/2.
%F A185279 a(n) = Sum_{i=1..floor(n/2)} [GCD(i, n-i) = 1] * c(i) * c(n-i), where c is the characteristic function of nonprimes (A005171) and [ ] is the Iverson bracket. - _Wesley Ivan Hurt_, Dec 08 2020
%e A185279 a(34) is the first even term with value greater than 1.  The number 34 = 33 + 1 and 25 + 9.  The latter sums meet the requirements listed in the definition. For odd n greater than 3, a(n) will always be at least 1 since 1 + (n - 1) is a sum that satisfies the definition.  For example a(5) = 1 since 5 = 1 + 4.
