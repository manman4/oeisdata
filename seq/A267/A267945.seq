%N A267945 Primes that are a prime power plus two.
%C A267945 The term 'prime power' refers to the elements of A246655.
%C A267945 If we were to extend the definition of prime power to include 1, then 3 would be the first term of the sequence, because 3 = 2^0 + 2.
%C A267945 The sequence is probably infinite, since it includes all the terms of A006512 (Greater of twin primes).
%C A267945 From _Robert Israel_, Jan 22 2016: (Start)
%C A267945 Since 3 divides p or p^k+2 if k is even, the only terms of the form p^k+2 where k is even are A228034.
%C A267945 All terms not in A057735 are congruent to 1 mod 3.
%C A267945 The generalized Bunyakovsky conjecture implies that for any odd k, there are infinitely many terms of the form p^k+2. (End)

%e A267945 5 is in the sequence because 5 = 3^1 + 2.
%e A267945 7 is in the sequence because 7 = 5^1 + 2.
%e A267945 11 is in the sequence because 11 = 3^2 + 2.
%e A267945 13 is in the sequence because 13 = 11^1 + 2.
%e A267945 29 is in the sequence because 29 = 3^3 + 2.
