%C A059992 From _Michael De Vlieger_, Jan 04 2025: (Start)
%C A059992 Conjecture: This sequence includes all highly composite numbers (from A002182) except 2 and 6, but there are other terms in this sequence (e.g., a(3) = 8, a(9) = 72) that are not highly composite.
%C A059992 Conjecture: a(n)/A007947(a(n)) is in A301414. (End)

%H A059992 Michael De Vlieger, <a href="/A059992/a059992.png">Plot S(n) = P(omega(n))*m at (x,y) = (m, omega(n))</a>, where S is the union of A002182 and this sequence, P is A002110, omega is A001221, and only select m that harbor S(n) shown. Shows the coincidence of many terms in this sequence with A002182. Blue represents m in A002182, gold m in both A002182 and this sequence; dark blue represents m in A002201 (and also in A002182), orange m in both A002201 and this sequence; red indicates terms in this sequence that are not in A002182. Green highlights terms in A002182 but are not determined to be in this sequence.
%e A059992 a(4)=12 because twelve has 4 nonprime divisors {1, 4, 6 and 12} whereas a(3)=8 has only 3; and twelve is the first number greater than eight which exhibits this property.
