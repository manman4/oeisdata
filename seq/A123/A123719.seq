%N A123719 An involution of nonnegative integers: signature permutation of Catalan automorphism which is obtained with recursion schema RIBS from automorphism *A085161.
%C A123719 Recursion schema RIBS is defined in A122200. Number of fixed points in range [A014137(n-1)..A014138(n-1)] of this permutation is given by INVERT transform of A001405, appropriately shifted.
