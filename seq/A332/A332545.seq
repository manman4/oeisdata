%e A332545 There are exactly 24 isomorphism classes of elliptic curves defined over Q with good reduction away from 2, classified by Ogg (1966).
%e A332545 There are 4 curves with j-invariant 128 given by y^2 = x^3 + x^2 + x + 1, y^2 = x^3 + x^2 + 3x - 5, y^2 = x^3 - x^2 + x - 1, and y^2 = x^3 - x^2 + 3x + 5.
%e A332545 There are 8 curves with j-invariant 1728 given by y^2 = x^3 - x, y^2 = x^3 + 4x, y^2 = x^3 - 4x, y^2 = x^3 + x, y^2 = x^3 - 2x, y^2 = x^3 + 8x, y^2 = x^3 -8x, and y^2 = x^3 + 2x.
