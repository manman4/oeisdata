%N A073200 Number of simple Catalan bijections of type B.
%C A073200 Each row is a permutation of nonnegative integers induced by a Catalan bijection (constructed as explained below) acting on the parenthesizations/plane binary trees as encoded and ordered by A014486/A063171.
%C A073200 The construction process is akin to the constructive mapping of primitive recursive functions to N: we have two basic primitives, A069770 (row 0) and A072796 (row 1), of which the former swaps the left and the right subtree of a binary tree and the latter exchanges the positions of the two leftmost subtrees of plane general trees, unless the tree's degree is less than 2, in which case it just fixes it. From then on, the even rows are constructed recursively from any other Catalan bijection in this table, using one of the five allowed recursion types:
%C A073200 0 - Apply the given Catalan bijection and then recurse down to both subtrees of the new binary tree obtained. (last decimal digit of row number = 2)
%C A073200 1 - First recurse down to both subtrees of the old binary tree and only after that apply the given Catalan bijection. (last digit = 4)
%C A073200 2 - Apply the given Catalan bijection and then recurse down to the right subtree of the new binary tree obtained. (last digit = 6)
%C A073200 3 - First recurse down to the right subtree of old binary tree and only after that apply the given Catalan bijection. (last digit = 8)
%C A073200 4 - First recurse down to the left subtree of old binary tree, after that apply the given Catalan bijection and then recurse down to the right subtree of the new binary tree. (last digit = 0)
%C A073200 The odd rows > 2 are compositions of the rows 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, ... (i.e. either one of the primitives A069770 or A072796, or one of the recursive compositions) at the left hand side and any Catalan bijection from the same array at the right hand side. See the scheme-functions index-for-recursive-sgtb and index-for-composed-sgtb how to compute the positions of the recursive and ordinary compositions in this table.

%Y A073200 Four other tables giving the corresponding cycle-counts: A073201, counts of the fixed elements: A073202, the lengths of the largest cycles: A073203, the LCM's of all the cycles: A073204. The ordinary compositions are encoded using the N X N -> N bijection A054238 (which in turn uses the bit-interleaving function A000695).
