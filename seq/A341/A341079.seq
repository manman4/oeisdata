%N A341079 Value of prime number D for incrementally largest values of minimal x satisfying the equation x^2 - D*y^2 = 5.
%C A341079 Analogous to A033316 for x^2 - D*y^2 = 1, and D is required to be prime, and for record values of x.

%e A341079 For D=29, the least x for which x^2 - D*y^2 = 5 has a solution is 11. The next prime, D, for which x^2 - D*y^2 = 5 has a solution is 31, but the smallest x in this case is 6, which is less than 11. The next prime, D, after 31 for which x^2 - D*y^2 = 5 has a solution is 41 and the least x for which it has a solution is 13, which is larger than 11, so it is a new record value. 29 is a term of this sequence and 11 is the corresponding term of A341080, but 31 is not a term of this sequence because at D=31 the least x for which x^2 - D*y^2 = 5 has a solution is not a record value.
