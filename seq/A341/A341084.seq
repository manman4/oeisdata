%N A341084 Incrementally largest values of minimal x satisfying the equation x^2 - D*y^2 = -5, where D is a prime number.
%C A341084 Analogous to A033315 for x^2 - D*y^2 = 1, and D required to be prime.

%e A341084 For D=29, the least x for which x^2 - D*y^2 = -5 has a solution is 16. The next prime, D, for which x^2 - D*y^2 = -5 has a solution is 41, but the smallest x in this case is 6, which is less than 16. The next prime, D, after 41 for which x^2 - D*y^2 = -5 has a solution is 61 and the least x for which it has a solution is 164, which is larger than 16, so it is a new record value. 29 is a term of A341083 and 16 is a term of this sequence, but 41 is not a term of A341083 because the least x for which x^2 - D*y^2 = -5 has a solution is not a record value.
