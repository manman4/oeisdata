%N A351458 Numbers k for which k * gcd(sigma(k), A276086(k)) is equal to sigma(k) * gcd(k, A276086(k)), where A276086 is the primorial base exp-function, and sigma gives the sum of divisors of its argument.
%C A351458 Numbers k such that k * A324644(k) = A000203(k) * A324198(k).
%C A351458 Numbers k such that gcd(A064987(k), A324580(k)) = gcd(A064987(k), A351252(k)).
%C A351458 Numbers k such that their abundancy index [sigma(k)/k] is equal to A324644(k)/A324198(k). See A364286.
%C A351458 A324644 gives odd values for even numbers and for the odd squares. A324198 is odd on all arguments, therefore on odd squares the above equation reduces to odd * odd = odd * odd, and on odd nonsquares as odd * even = even * odd. It is an open question whether there are any odd terms after the initial a(1)=1.
%C A351458 If k is even, but not a multiple of 3, then A276086(k) is a multiple of 3, but not even (i.e., is an odd multiple of 3). If for such k also sigma(k) = 3*k, then A007949(A324644(k)) = min(A007949(sigma(k)), A007949(A276086(k))) = 1, while A007949(A324198(k)) = min(A007949(k), A007949(A276086(k))) = 0, therefore all such k's do occur in this sequence, for example, the two known terms of A005820 (3-perfect numbers) that are not multiples of three: 459818240, 51001180160, but also any hypothetical term of A005820 of the form 4u+2, where 2u+1 is not multiple of 3, and which by necessity is then also an odd perfect number.
%C A351458 Similarly, of the 65 known 5-multiperfect numbers (A046060), those 20 that are not multiples of five are included in this sequence. Note that all 65 are multiples of six.
%C A351458 It is conjectured that the intersection of this sequence with the multiperfect numbers (A007691) gives A323653, see comments in the latter.
%C A351458 For all even terms k of this sequence, A007814(A000203(k)) = A007814(k), sigma preserves the 2-adic valuation, and A007949(A000203(k)) >= A007949(k), i.e., does not decrease the 3-adic valuation. The condition is equivalence (=) when k is a multiple of 6. With odd terms, any hypothetical odd perfect number x would yield a one greater 2-adic valuation for sigma(x) than for x, but would satisfy the main condition of this sequence. - Corrected Feb 17 2022
%C A351458 Like in A351549 also here any term that is a nonsquare positive odd number (in A088828) is by necessity also a term of A191218. - _Antti Karttunen_, Mar 10 2024

%C A351458 This has common with sequences like A351549, A351554, A387165, etc, that for all primes p dividing sigma(n), it is required that the valuation of the same prime p in n is equal, i.e., that v_p(n) == v_p(sigma(n)), except that condition is either ignored or relaxed for a certain set of primes, with that set given by a rather arbitrary function of n, more or less unrelated to sigma.
%C A351458 In this case the "rather arbitrary" function is A276086, so this sequence gives numbers k such that, when x = A276086(k), then for all primes p|x, v_p(k)+min(v_p(x), v_p(sigma(k))) is equal to v_p(sigma(k))+min(v_p(x), v_p(k)), and for all the other primes q, it is required that v_q(sigma(k)) = v_q(k), where v_p(.) stands for the p-adic valuation. See the PARI-program dated Sep 17 2025 and the examples.
%C A351458 Of the initial 200 terms, 137 are also in A388275.

%e A351458 a(9) = 354892 = 2^2 * 17^2 * 307 is included, because sigma(354892) = 661892 = 2^2 * 7^2 * 11 * 307 and A276086(354892) = 1107818291712259869287708402970732127125 = 3^2 * 5^3 * 7^6 * 11^6 * 13^10 * 17^11, so for the primes 7 and 11 and 17 present in the latter, we see that 0+min(6,2) == 2+min(6,0) (for 7), 0+min(6,1) = 1+min(6,0) (for 11) and 2+min(11,0) == 0+min(11,2) for (for 17), while the primes 2 and 307 have equal exponents in both k and sigma(k).
%e A351458 a(159) = 13752463725 = (3*5*7*11*13)^2 * 61 (= k) is included, because sigma(k) = 34663652478 = 2 * 3^2 * 7 * 13 * 19^2 * 31^2 * 61, and A276086(k) = 2^1 * 3^1 * 5^2 * 7^3 * 11^5 * 13^6 * 17^11 * 19^15 * 23^14 * 29^3 * 31^2, thus the latter "filter" takes care of the mismatching exponents of primes 2, 5, 7, 11, 13, 19 and 31 in k vs. sigma(k), while prime 3 has the exponent 2 in both, and prime 61 is unitary in both. Note also that 13752463725 is the first term of A228058 in this sequence.
