%N A079255 a(n) is taken to be the smallest positive integer greater than a(n-1) such that the condition "n is in the sequence if and only if a(n) is odd and a(n+1) is even" can be satisfied.
%C A079255 No two terms in the sequence are consecutive integers (see example for a(3)).

%F A079255 With the convention A026363(0)=0 (offset is 1 for this sequence) we have a(n)=A026363(2n)+1; a(n)=(1+sqrt(3))*n+O(1). The sequence satisfies the meta-system for n>=2: a(a(n))=2*a(n)+2*n+2 ; a(a(n)-1)=2*a(n)+2*n-1 ; a(a(n)-2)=2*a(n)+2*n-4 which allows us to have all terms since first differences =2 or 3 only. a(n)=a(n-1)+3 if n is in A026363, a(n)=a(n-1)+2 otherwise (if n is in A026364). - _Benoit Cloitre_, Apr 23 2008
%e A079255 a(2) cannot be odd; it also cannot be 2, since that would imply that a(2) was odd. 4 is the smallest value for a(2) that creates no contradiction.
%e A079255 a(3) cannot be 5, which would imply that a(5) was odd because it is known from 4's being in the sequence that a(4) is odd and a(5) even. 6 is the smallest value for a(3) that creates no contradiction.
