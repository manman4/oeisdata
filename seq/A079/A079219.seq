%N A079219 Triangle T(n,d) (listed row-wise: T(1,1)=1, T(2,1)=1, T(2,2)=1, T(3,1)=2, T(3,2)=0, T(3,3)=1, ...) giving the number of n-edge general plane trees with root degree d that are fixed by the three-fold application of Catalan Automorphisms A057511/A057512 (Deep rotation of general parenthesizations/plane trees).
%C A079219 Note: the counts given here are inclusive, i.e. T(n,d) includes also the count A079217(n,d).

%Y A079219 The row sums equal to the left edge shifted left once = A079224 = third row of A079216 (the latter gives the Maple procedure PFixedByA057511). Cf. also A079217-A079222 and A003056 and A002262.
