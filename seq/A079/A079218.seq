%N A079218 Triangle T(n,d) (listed row-wise: T(1,1)=1, T(2,1)=1, T(2,2)=1, T(3,1)=2, T(3,2)=2, T(3,3)=1, ...) giving the number of n-edge general plane trees with root degree d that are fixed by the two-fold application of Catalan Automorphisms A057511/A057512 (Deep rotation of general parenthesizations/plane trees).
%C A079218 Note: the counts given here are inclusive, i.e. T(n,d) includes also the count A079217(n,d).
