%N A175854 Number of anagrams of n that are divisible by exactly 3 primes (counted with multiplicity).
%C A175854 An anagram of a k-digit number is a permutation of the digits that does not begin with 0.
%C A175854 This is to A014612, as A131371 is to semiprimes A001358, and as A046810 is to primes A000040.
%C A175854 The first term > 1 is a(103)=2.

%e A175854 a(125) = 1 because 125 = 5^3 is divisible by exactly 3 primes (counted with multiplicity); 152 = 2^3 * 19 is in A014613 (quadruprimes); 215 = 5 * 43 is a semiprime; 251 is prime; 512 = 2^9; and 521 is prime.
