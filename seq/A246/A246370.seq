%F A246370 a(1) = 1, and for n >= 1, if A010051(n) = 1 [i.e. when n is prime], a(n) = 1 + a(A000720(n)), otherwise a(n) = a(A065855(n)). [A000720(n) and A065855(n) tell the number of primes, and respectively, composites <= n].
%F A246370 a(n) = A080791(A135141(n)). [a(n) tells also the number of nonleading zeros in binary representation of A135141(n)].
%F A246370 a(n) = A000120(A246377(n))-1. [Respectively, one less than the number of 1-bits in 0/1-swapped version of that sequence].
%F A246370 a(n) = A246348(n) - A246369(n) - 1.
%e A246370 Consider n=30. It is the 19th composite number in A002808: 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 30, ...
%e A246370 Thus we consider next n=19, which is the 8th prime in A000040: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, ...
%e A246370 So we proceed with n=8, which is the 3rd composite number, and then with n=3, which is the 2nd prime, and then with n=2 which is the 1st prime, and we have finished.
%e A246370 All in all, it took us 5 steps (A246348(30) = 6 = 5+1) to reach 1, and on the journey, we encountered three primes, 19, 3 and 2, thus a(30) = 3.
