%N A246064 A variation of the Farey sequence read by rows; the row of order n is defined by the greatest whole numbers less than or equal to the values generated when the numerators of the Farey sequence (order n) are replaced by n itself.
%C A246064 Consider the area on the coordinate plane swept by a polar angle ranging from 0 to Pi/4 radians. Take every integer coordinate pair from that area whose coordinate components do not exceed the magnitude of n (i.e., if n=9, coordinate (9, 3) is chosen but not (10, 3) ). There would be a distinct number of angles between 0 and Pi/4 radians representing each point's polar angle. For large enough n, some points would share the same angle; for instance, where n=9, Cartesian points (3, 1), (6, 2), and (9, 3) would be chosen, yet all would have the radian angle arctan(1/3).
%C A246064 Consider these unique angle values in ascending order. Replace each angle with the number of points that could be represented in polar form with that angle (i.e., arctan(1/3) from the above example would be replaced with 3). This will result in row n of the sequence.
%C A246064 Row n has A005728(n) terms.
%F A246064 Row n of the sequence (sequence of order n) is given by floor(n/A006843(n)).
%e A246064 As an example, the 4th row of the sequence (n=4) is 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4.
