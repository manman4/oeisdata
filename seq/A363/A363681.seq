%N A363681 Sphenic numbers sandwiched between two squarefree semiprimes.
%C A363681 Sphenic numbers are numbers that are products of three distinct primes.
%C A363681 This sequence is different from A362811: sphenic numbers sandwiched between semiprimes, as semiprimes are products of two primes that might not be distinct.

%e A363681 186 = 2*3*31 is a sphenic number sandwiched between 185 = 5*37 and 187 = 11*17, both of which are squarefree semiprimes. Thus, 186 is in this sequence.
%e A363681 290 = 2*5*29 is a sphenic number sandwiched between semiprimes 289 = 17*17 and 291 = 3*97, one of which is not squarefree. Thus, 290 is not in this sequence but in A362811.
