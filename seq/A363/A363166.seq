%N A363166 Bouton numbers: a(n) is the number of P positions in games of Nim with three nonzero heaps each containing at most n sticks.
%C A363166 In combinatorial game theory, if the next player cannot win (assuming perfect play) we call this a P position.
%C A363166 Bouton (1901) called P positions in Nim "safe combinations" and provided a list of 35 such positions in games with less than 16 sticks in each heap. Bouton excluded positions where any heap has been reduced to zero sticks. This seems reasonable since if a pile is removed the game is reduced to a two-heap Nim game, so we follow Bouton here.
%C A363166 These positions have Nim sum zero. Nim sum is calculated by converting the heap sizes to binary and applying bitwise XOR addition.
%C A363166 The paper cited named the game Nim and provided the first known mathematical analysis.

%F A363166 Conjecture: a(n) = A000217(n) - A063915(n-1). - _Alan Michael Gómez Calderón_, Sep 18 2025
%e A363166 With n=1, there is one stick in each pile. This is an N position (the next player can force a win) since the next player can take any stick and 0 1 1 is a P position, so a(1)=0.
%e A363166 With n=3, the only P position is 1 2 3, so a(3)=1. This is the simplest P position in three-heap Nim in that it uses the least number of sticks overall.
%e A363166 Bouton's list is a(15)=35: 1 2 3, 1 4 5, 1 6 7, 1 8 9, 1 10 11, 1 12 13, 1 14 15, 2 4 6, 2 5 7, 2 8 10, 2 9 11, 2 12 14, 2 13 15, 3 4 7, 3 5 6, 3 8 11, 3 9 10, 3 12 15, 3 13 14, 4 8 12, 4 9 13, 4 10 14, 4 11 15, 5 8 13, 5 9 12, 5 10 15, 5 11 14, 6 8 14, 6 9 15, 6 10 12, 6 11 13, 7 8 15, 7 9 14, 7 10 13, 7 11 12.
