%N A376842 Asymptotic phase shift of the tetration base n written by juxtaposing its representative congruence classes modulo 10 (i.e., the 1, 2, or 4, distinct sfasamenti taken by starting from the minimum height such that the congruence speed of n is constant), and a(n) = -1 if n is a multiple of 10.
%C A376842 By Definition 1.2 of "Number of stable digits of any integer tetration" (see Links), let bar_b be the smallest hyperexponent of the tetration m^^b such that the congruence speed of m is constant.
%C A376842 Then, assuming that n is not a multiple of 10, we define as asymptotic phase shift (original name "sfasamento asintotico" - see References, "La strana coda della serie n^n^...^n", Chapter 7) the subsequence of the 4 (or 2 or even 1) congruence classes of the differences between the rightmost non-stable digits of n^^(bar_b) (i.e., the least significant digit of the tetration n^^(bar_b) that is not frozen as we move to n^^(b + 1)) and the corresponding digit of n^^(bar_b + 1), and ditto for (n^^(bar_b + 1) and n^^(bar_b + 2)), (n^^(bar_b + 2) and n^^(bar_b + 3)), (n^^(bar_b + 3) and n^^(bar_b + 4)).
%C A376842 Now, let us indicate this subsequence as [s_1, s_2, s_3, s_4] and then, if s_1 = s_3 and also s_2 = s_4, we transform [s_1, s_2, s_3, s_4] into [s_1, s_2], and lastly, if s_1 = s_2, we transform [s_1, s_2] into [s_1].
%C A376842 Finally, we get a(n) by juxtaposing all the 4 (or 2, or 1) digits inside [...] (e.g., if n = 3, then bar_b = 2 so that we get s_1 = 4 = s_3 and s_2 = 6 = s_4, and consequently a(3) = 46 instead of 4646 - see Definition 3.2 of "Graham's number stable digits: an exact solution" in Links).
%C A376842 Assuming that n is not a multiple of 10, in general, for any given pair of nonnegative integers c and k, the congruence class modulo 10 of the difference between the least significant digits of n^^(bar_b+c+4*k) and n^^(bar_b+c+1+4*k) does not depend on k. Moreover, if s_1 <> s_2, then s_1 + s_3 = s_2 + s_4 = 10.
%C A376842 In detail, if the last digit of n is 5, then a(n) = 5, while if n is coprime to 5, a(n) mandatorily belongs to the following set: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 19, 28, 37, 46, 64, 73, 82, 91, 1397, 1793, 2486, 2684, 3179, 3971, 4268, 4862, 6248, 6842, 7139, 7931, 8426, 8624, 9317, 9713}.
%C A376842 The author conjectures that if n is not a multiple of 10, then a(n) is necessarily an element of the subset {2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 19, 28, 46, 64, 82, 2486, 2684, 3971, 4268, 4862, 6248, 6842, 7931, 8426, 8624}.
%C A376842 As a mere consequence of a(3) = 46 and the fact that congruence speed of 3 is 0 at height 1 and 1 at any height above 1, it follows that 4 is equal to the difference between the slog_3(G)-th least significant digit of Graham's number, G, and the slog_3(G)-th least significant digit of any power tower of the form 3^3^3^... whose height is above slog_3(G) (where slog(...) indicates the super-logarithm of the argument).
%C A376842 By definition, a(n) consists of a circular permutation of the digits of A376446(n).

%e A376842 a(3) = 46 since the congruence speed of 3^^b becomes constant starting from height 2 and its value is 0 for b = 1 and 1 for any b >= 2, then (3^3 - 3^(3^3))/10 == 4 (mod 10) while (3^(3^3) - 3^(3^(3^3)))/10^2 == 6 (mod 10).
