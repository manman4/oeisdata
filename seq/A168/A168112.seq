%N A168112 Toothpick sequence starting with a straight line, with angle = Pi/4, from which protrudes a half toothpick.
%C A168112 On the infinite square grid, we start at round 0 drawing a straight line, with angle = Pi/4, from which protrudes a half toothpick.
%C A168112 At round 1 we place an orthogonal toothpick centered at the end.
%C A168112 In each subsequent round, for every exposed toothpick end, place an orthogonal toothpick centered at that end.
%C A168112 The sequence gives the number of toothpicks after n rounds.
%C A168112 See also A168113, the first differences.
%C A168112 For more information see A139250, which is the main entry for this sequence.
