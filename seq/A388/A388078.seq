%N A388078 Smallest prime p such that p + 6^i is prime for all i = 1 to n and not for i = n + 1.
%C A388078 There are no primes p such that p + 6^i are prime for i from 1 to n >= 10, because at least one of p and p + 6^i for i from 1 to 10 is divisible by 11.
%e A388078 a(2) = 5, because both 5 + 6^1 = 11 and 5 + 6^2 = 41 are prime, 5 + 6^3 = 221 = 13 * 17 is not prime and no smaller prime p < 5 satisfies the condition that p + 6^i is prime for all i=1 to 2 and not for i = 3.
%o A388078 (PARI) a(n) = my(p=2); while (! ((#select(isprime, vector(n, i, p + 6^i)) == n) && !isprime(p+6^(n+1))), p=nextprime(p+1)); p; \\ _Michel Marcus_, Oct 17 2025
