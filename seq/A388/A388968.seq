%N A388968 Table read by rows: earliest group of n consecutive numbers such that, beyond the first number, no number's prime factor exponents equal any prime factor exponent of the previous number.
%C A388968 It is plausible that a group of 6 does not exist, although this is unknown.
%e A388968 The row for n = 4 is 7, 8, 9, 10 as 7 = 7^1, 8 = 2^3, 9 = 2^2, 10 = 2^1*5^1, and the prime exponents of 8, 9 and 10 do not equal any of those of 7, 8 and 9 respectively.
%e A388968 The row for n = 5 is 24, 25, 26, 27, 28 as 24 = 2^3*3^1, 25 = 5^2, 26 = 2^1*13^1, 27 = 3^3, 28 = 2^2*7^1, and the prime exponents of 25, 26, 27 and 28 do not equal any of those of 24, 25, 26 and 27 respectively.
