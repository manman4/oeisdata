%N A388144 Powerful numbers (A061862) representable as a sum of nonnegative powers of their digits in a unique way.
%C A388144 a(n) with the decimal representation a(n) = d_1 d_2 ... d_k is a term iff there is a unique ordered set of nonnegative integers m_1, m_2, ..., m_k >= 0 such that a(n) = d_1^m_1 + ... + d_k^m_k.
%C A388144 For any such term, the exponential Diophantine equation d_1 d_2 ... d_k = d_1^m_1 + ... + d_k^m_k with respect to m_1, m_2, ..., m_k has a unique solution in nonnegative integers.
%C A388144 Different powers of duplicate digits allow for multiple representations after a permutation, so that terms with equal digits must have equal powers on those positions (contrary to the definition of A050240, where such representations are considered equivalent).
%C A388144 None of the digits in a(n) can be 0 or 1, as it results in multiple representations, which makes it a subsequence of A387032.
%C A388144 A061862(k) is a term in this sequence iff A384099(k) = 1.

%e A388144 2 = 2^1, which is the only possible representation (the same holds for any single-digit number from 2 to 9);
%e A388144 24 = 2^3 + 4^2;
%e A388144 254 = 2^7 + 5^3 + 4^0;
%e A388144 9963 = 9^3 + 9^3 + 6^5 + 3^6;
%e A388144 98764 = 9^2 + 8^5 + 7^3 + 6^2 + 4^8.
%e A388144 Counterexamples:
%e A388144 264 is not a term because it has two distinct representations (see A050240):
%e A388144 264 = 2^1 + 6^1 + 4^4 = 2^5 + 6^3 + 4^2.
%e A388144 224 is not a term because 224 = 2^5 + 2^7 + 4^3 = 2^7 + 2^5 + 4^3 (these two representations are considered equivalent in A050240 because of duplicate digits).
%e A388144 153 = 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 is a narcissistic number (A005188). It is not a term since an infinite number of other representations exist: 153 = 1^m + 5^3 + 3^3 for any m >= 0.
