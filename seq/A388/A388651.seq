%N A388651 a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2; for n > 2, a(n) is the smallest unused positive number that has at least one prime exponent in its prime factorization that equals a prime exponent in the prime factorization of a(n-1).
%C A388651 The graph of the sequence shows similarities to the EKG sequence A064413, except that here it is the prime powers, in particular the powers of two, that cause the large blips in the graph as opposed to the primes themselves. In the terms studied, all terms a(n) = 2^k for k>=4 are preceded by 3*2^k and followed by 5*2^k, the later term being approximately at index n = 12*2^(k-2). It is likely this behavior is true for all k.
%C A388651 Terms that contain only prime exponents greater than 1 in their prime factorization also cause small blips in the graph. The vast majority of other terms are either equal to n itself, hence are fixed points, or are just 1 or 2 more than n.
%C A388651 The sequence is conjectured to be a permutation of the positive integers.
