%N A388999 Numbers k such that A135311(k) = A008407(k).
%C A388999 In other words, numbers k such that the greedy prime k-tuple pattern has the minimum possible diameter.
%C A388999 It seems likely that this sequence is finite and that 67 is the last term.
%H A388999 Wikipedia, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_k-tuple">Prime k-tuple</a>.
%e A388999 6 is not a term, because the first 6 terms of A135311 give the prime pattern (0, 2, 6, 8, 12, 18=A135311(6)), but there is a denser pattern (0, 4, 6, 10, 12, 16=A008407(6)).
%e A388999 7 is a term, because the first 7 terms of A135311 give the prime pattern (0, 2, 6, 8, 12, 18, 20=A135311(7)), and since also A008407(7) = 20 there is no denser pattern.
