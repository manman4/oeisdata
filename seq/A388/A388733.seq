%N A388733 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) = numerators of "across the board" style tournament payouts.
%C A388733 In a tournament where each entry fee is treated as an "across the board" bet equally divided among all paid-out placings, each placing's pool is shared among players who finish at or above that placing. The sequence forms a triangle read by rows, T(n,k), where n = number of paid-out players and k = placing. Dividing T(n,k) by n*n! gives the fraction of the total pool awarded to that placing.
%C A388733 Each row sums to n*n!.
%F A388733 T(n,k) = n! * Sum_{j=k..n} (1/j), for 1 <= k <= n.
%e A388733 In a tournament with 5 paid out winners, a participant places 3rd. They receive (1/3+1/4+1/5)*(1/5) = T(5,3)/(5*5!) = 94/600 = 15.67 percent of the pool.
