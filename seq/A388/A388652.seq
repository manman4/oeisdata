%N A388652 a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2; for n > 2, a(n) is the smallest unused positive number that shares a factor with a(n-1) and has at least one prime exponent in its prime factorization that equals a prime exponent in the prime factorization of a(n-1).
%C A388652 The graph of the sequence is similar to the EKG sequence A064413, but also has prime-power related terms that do not lie on the three main lines of the graph; see A388651 for further details. However, like A064413, for the terms studied the primes appear in their natural order, and for primes p >= 7 are preceded by 2*p and followed by 3*p.
%C A388652 In the first 250000 terms the fixed points are 1, 2, 28, 35, 38, 65, 121, 215, 323; it is likely no more exist. The sequence is conjectured to be a permutation of the positive integers.

%H A388652 Scott R. Shannon, <a href="/A388652/a388652.png">Image of the first 100000 terms</a>. The colors are graduated across the spectrum from red to violet to show the maximum exponent in the prime factorization of the terms, with red being 1. Terms with a maximum exponent >=8 are shown as white. The thin green line is a(n) = n.
%e A388652 a(7) = 18 = 2^1*3^2 as a(6) = 4 = 2^2, 18 is unused and shares a factor with 4, and both 18 and 4 have the prime exponent 2 in their prime factorizations.
