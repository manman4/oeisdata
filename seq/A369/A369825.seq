%N A369825 a(1,2) = 1,2; thereafter let i = a(n-2) and r(n) = a(1)*a(2)*...*a(n-1): a(n) is the smallest novel multiple m of w = rad(r(n))/rad(i), where rad is A007947.
%C A369825 Rad(r(n)) is always a primorial (A002110), and there are two distinct ways a prime p > 2 can enter the sequence:
%C A369825 (i). Directly: rad(i) = rad(r(n)) implies a(n) is the least unused term, conjectured to be the smallest prime p not already in the sequence. In this case no prior term is divisible by p. This happens for 3, 5, 7. It is not known if this ever happens again (thought to be unlikely).
%C A369825 (ii). Indirectly: rad(i) and rad(r(n)) are consecutive primorials whose quotient is prime p = gpd(rad(r(n)). This implies that p has already entered the sequence as divisor of a previous (composite) term, since then p|rad(r(n)), and r(n) is the product of all prior terms, so p must be a factor of at least one of them.
%C A369825 In the first case m is the least novel multiple of 1, and rad(r(n)) increments to the next primorial at the point of entry a(n) = p. In the second case rad(r(n)) increments (to the next primorial; gpf = p) at the earliest term a(t); t < n where p | a(t). Example: a(35) = 55, the earliest term divisible by 11. We see six more composite terms divisible by 11, before finally a(47) = 11.
%C A369825 Prime terms occur in order as shown in Example, but only as far as 61. Primes do not appear in order for n > 667722.
%C A369825 For n < 667722, with r(A) = P(k+1) following prime(k+1) | a(A) for A < n, we admit a(n-2) = P(k) and a(n) = prime(k+1) where n < B such that r(B) = P(k+2) following prime(k+2) | a(B). For sufficiently small n, primes a(n) = prime(k+1) follow primorials a(n-2) = P(k) in the sequence.
%C A369825 Primorials and primes decouple such that a(676472) = P(18), but a(676474) = 4757 = prime(19)*prime(20). This is the result of r(n) increasing twice (at n = 253724 and 667722), offering a greater degree of freedom for a(676474) than for terms that follow previous instances of primorials in the sequence. We also have a(9061722) = 73, following a(9061720) = P(23)/73. Primorials a(n) = P(k) do not appear in order for n > 681764.
%C A369825 Powerful numbers in the sequence are sparse, since they require w to appear m times such that m*w is powerful. Only 10 powerful numbers appear for n <= 2^24. Even after 2^24 terms, 36 is still missing. Therefore the sequence is predominantly of weak numbers.
%C A369825 It is not known if this sequence could be a permutation of A000027.
