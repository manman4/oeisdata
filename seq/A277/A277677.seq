%N A277677 Each even term "t" of the sequence is followed by t odd terms and each even digit "k" of the sequence is followed by k odd digits.
%C A277677 After a(1) = 0, the sequence is always extended with the smallest integer not yet present which does not lead to a contradiction.
%C A277677 In a private mail to Eric Angelini, Lars Blomberg wrote about the b-file: "Only the even terms 0, 2, 4, 10, 1110, 12, 110, 6, 8, 2110, 2112, 2114, 14, 16, 18, 1112, 112, 2116 [are in this b-file]; so the sequence will continue from 2116 on with 2116 odd numbers, then an even one, etc."

%e A277677 There are respectively 0 odd terms after "0", then 2 odd terms after "2" (they are 1 and 3), then 4 odd terms after "4" (they are 5, 7, 9 and 121), then 10 odd terms after "10" (they are 221, 123, 125, 127, 129, 141, 11, 143, 13 and 145), etc.
%e A277677 But there are also respectively 0 odd digits after "0", then 2 odd digits after "2" (they are 1 and 3), then 4 odd digits after "4" (they are 4, 5, 7, 9 and 1), then 2 odd digits after the "2" of "121" (they are the last "1" of "121" and the starting "1" of "10"), then 0 odd digits after "0", then 2 odd digits after the "2" of "21" (they are the "1" of "21" and the starting "1" of 123), etc.
