%N A277739 Number of isomorphism classes of connected plane 4-regular multigraphs.
%C A277739 Previous name was: Number of link shadows with n crossings.
%C A277739 A link shadow is a connected plane 4-regular multigraph, allowing loops and multiple edges. Also: number of plane quadrangulations (allowing multiple edges) with n+2 vertices. In each case the sequence counts isomorphism classes which respect the embedding, with mirror image being an isomorphism. - _Brendan McKay_, Mar 10 2023

%e A277739 a(1)=1 corresponds to a single vertex with two loops. a(2)=3 corresponds to two vertices joined by 4 edges or two vertices with loops joined by 2 edges. In the last case, the two loops may lie in the same face or different faces and these are not isomorphic.
%Y A277739 A054935 is the same but not allowing mirror image as an isomorphism.
