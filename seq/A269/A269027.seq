%N A269027 Parity of the number of 1's in A039724(n).
%C A269027 An analog of Thue-Morse sequence in base -2: a(n) is the parity of number of 1's in the extension of n in negabinary (A039724).
%C A269027 Conjecture. Let A_k denote the first 2^k terms; then A_0={0} and for even k>=0, A_(k+1)= A_kB_k, where B_k is obtained from A_k by complementing its 0's and 1's; for odd k>=1, A_(k+1)= A_kC_k, where C_k is obtained from A_k by complementing its last (2/3)*(2^(k-1)-1) 0's and 1's.
%C A269027 For example,A_2={0,1,0,1}. Then B_2={1,0,1,0} and A_3={0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0}; further, C_3 is obtained from A_3 complementing its last 2 0's and 1's. So, A_4={0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1}.
%C A269027 Theorem. Conjecture is true. - _Vladimir Shevelev_, Feb 20 2016
%C A269027 From _Vladimir Shevelev_, Feb 18 2016: (Start)
%C A269027 Theorem: The sequence is cubefree.
%C A269027 Proof: First note that there are no three consecutive equal terms - this follows from the formula suggested by _Robert Israel_ (see below) which was proved in the Shevelev link.
%C A269027 The sequence is cubefree if it does not contain a subsequence of the form XXX. Here we consider only one of several cases (the others are handled in a similar way). Let n==0 (mod 4), s==2 or 3 (mod 4). For example, if s=2, consider XXX with positions (4*k,4*k+1)(4*k+2,4*k+3)(4*k+4,4*k+5).
%C A269027 Suppose a(4*k)=a(4*k+2)=a(4*k+4), then a(k)=1-a(k+1)=a(k+1), a contradiction; if s=3, consider XXX with positions (4*k,4*k+1,4*k+2) (4*k+3,4*k+4,4*k+5) (4*k+6,4*k+7,4*k+8). Then a(4*k)=a(4*k+3)=a(4*k+6), a(k)=a(k+1), and a(4*k+1)=a(4*k+4)=a(4*k+7), 1-a(k)=a(k+1)=a(k).
%C A269027   A contradiction. (End)
%C A269027 In general for odd s>3, n=4*k, let first s=4*m+1, m>=1, s>=5. Let XXX have positions (4*k,...,4*k+s-1)(4*k+s,...,4*k+2*s-1)(4*k+2*s,...,4*k+3*s-1). Consider in the first X a(4*k+3) and in the second X a(4*k+3+s). Then we should have a(4*k+3)=a(4*k+3+s)=a(4*k+4*m+4) or a(k+1)=a(k+m+1). Now in the first X we consider a(4k+4) and in the second X a(4*k+4+s). Then we should have a(4*k+4)=a(4*k+4+4*m+1) or a(k+1)=1-a(k+m+1). So a(k+m+1)= 1-a(k+m+1), a contradiction. Further, if s=4*m+3, m>=1, s>=7, in the same way we obtain a contradiction, choosing in the first X a(4*k)=a(k) and a(4*k+1)=1-a(k), then comparing with a(4*k+4*m+3)=a(k+m+1) and a(4*k+4*m +4)=a(k+m+1) in the second X we obtain a(k+m+1)=a(k) and a(k+m+1)=1-a(k). A contradiction. - _Vladimir Shevelev_, May 08 2017
%C A269027 Finally consider the general case of even s, also demonstrating it for n=4*k. Let first s=4*m+2, m>=1. Then we have the following 4 pairs of equations:
%C A269027   a(4*k+1) = 1-a(k), a(4*k+4*m+3) = a(k+m+1);
%C A269027   a(4*k+2) = 1-a(k+1), a(4*k+4*m+4) = a(k+m+1);
%C A269027   a(4*k+4) = a(k+1), a(4*k+4*m+6) = 1-a(k+m+2);
%C A269027   a(4*k+6) = 1-a(k+2), a(4*k+4*m+8) = a(k+m+2).
%C A269027 From the first two pairs we find a(k)=a(k+1). From the last two pars we find a(k+1)=a(k+2). So a(k)=a(k+1)=a(k+2), a contradiction. Analogously we prove the considered cases of s when n==1,2,3 (mod 4). The case s = 4*m now is proved easily by a simple induction (in more detail see in [shevelev] link, Section 7). - _Vladimir Shevelev_, May 11 2017
%C A269027 Note that the sequence has two additional common properties with the Thue-Morse sequence (cf. [Offner] link). 1) In the [Shevelev] link we show that a(2*n)=1-a(2*n+1). Thus if a(n)= a(n+1), then n should be odd. 2) Show also that in any 5 consecutive terms there must be 2 consecutive equal terms. Indeed, in other cases we should have either consecutive terms 10101 or 01010. Consider the case that the first term has position 4*k (other cases can be dealt with in the same way). Then in the first case we should have a(4*k) =a(k)=1, ... , a(4*k+3)=a(k+1)=0, a(4*k+4)= a(k+1)=1, a contradiction (and the same contradiction for the second case). - _Vladimir Shevelev_, May 14 2017
%C A269027 Consider the constant G=0.0101101001011..._2 which is obtained by the concatenated terms {a(n)} and interpreted as a binary real number G. Theorem. G is transcendental number. A proof one is given in the [shevelev] link, Section 9. - _Vladimir Shevelev_, May 24 2017
%C A269027 If W(n) is the infinite word formed from the terms {a(n)} and M is the morphism {0 -> 1001, 1 -> 0110} then M(W(n)) = 10|W(n). - _Charlie Neder_, Jun 10 2019
