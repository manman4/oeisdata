%N A098737 Triangle read by rows: number of triangles formed by lines from two vertices of a triangle to the opposite side that segment the opposite sides into m and n segments. Since f(m,n) = f(n,m), it suffices to give the results in a triangular table.
%C A098737 Frank Buss gave this as a puzzle; K. L. Metlov solved it, submitting his result in the J language created by Kenneth Iverson. The program given below is only five tokens long. J defines a series of three functions to be a "fork" defined by x (f g h ) y = (x f y) g (f h y) - a generalization of the usual mathematical practice of writing (f + g) y to mean (f y) + (g y). J also has a primitive "half" and has a dummy function "cap" whose purpose is to permit more forks to be written. 3 (* * +) 5 is thus (3 * 5) * (3 + 5) or 120. cap half 3 (* * +) 5 is thus 60.
%C A098737 This sequence is the dimensions of the various irreducible representations of SU(3). In the language of physics, the integers m and n are one more than the numbers of quarks or antiquarks, respectively, that label the representation. - _Alex Meiburg_, Dec 13 2020 =
%C A098737 Comment on the previous one: D(n, m) = f(m+1, n+1) = (n+1)*(m+1)*(n+m+2), for 0 <= m <= n, (given as array D(n,m) as example in A212331) is the dimension of the irreducible SU(3) multiplet (n, m), denoted also by D(n, m). The multiplet (m, n) is denoted also by a bar over D(n, m). The irreducuble tensor t(n, m) is symmetric in n upper indices from {1,2,3}, symmetric in m lower indices, and traceless in every pair of an upper and a lower index. See the Coleman reference for a derivation. - _Wolfdieter Lang_, Dec 18 2020
