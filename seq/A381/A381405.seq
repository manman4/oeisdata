%N A381405 a(0) = 0; for n > 0, a(n) is the smallest unused number such that a(n) AND a(n-1) = 0, where AND is the binary AND operation, while the binary weight of a(n) does not equal that of a(n-1).
%C A381405 In the first 100000 terms the fixed points are 0, 1, 28, 76, 543, 1580, although more likely exist.

%e A381405 a(3) = 8 = 1000_2 as 8 is unused and a(2) = 6 = 110_2, and 1000_2 AND 110_2 = 0 while the binary weights of 8 and 6 are 1 and 2 respectively.
