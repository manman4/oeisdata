%N A381463 Limiting sequence of the possible number of inversions in stable configurations of 4^n-1 chips in a chip firing-game directed 4-ary tree resulting from a permutation-based strategy of firing chips.
%C A381463 Consider a 4-ary, rooted infinite directed tree where each vertex has outdegree 4. A chip firing game on this tree is defined as in Section 2 of Inagaki, Khovanova, and Luo (2025). Here we start with 4^n chips labeled 0,1, ..., 4^n-1 at the root.
%C A381463 Let A(4, n) be the increasing sequence of all possible numbers of inversions in stable configurations in a chip-firing game on a directed regular 4-ary tree starting with 4^n chips resulting from applying a permutation-based strategy corresponding to permutation w of 1,2,..., n. In the strategy, for each i = 1, 2, ..., n, chips with j as the w_i-th most significant digit sent to the (j+1)-th leftmost child of the fired vertex. For each n divide each element in A(4, n) by 4^(n-1) * 9 and put the resulting elements in order from smallest to greatest. These are the first several terms of the sequence.
%C A381463 This sequence was defined at the end of Section 4.3 of Inagaki, Khovanova, and Luo (2025).
