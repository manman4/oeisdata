%N A381137 Lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct positive integers such that no 3 terms are in harmonic progression.
%C A381137 A harmonic progression is a sequence of values whose reciprocals are in arithmetic progression. Equivalently, if (a, b, c) is a harmonic progression, then b is the harmonic mean of a and c.
%C A381137 a(n) is the smallest integer greater than a(n-1) which does not form a 3-term harmonic progression with 2 previously occurring terms.
%C A381137 Every prime occurs in the sequence.

%e A381137 6 is not a term in the sequence because it would form a harmonic progression with 2 and 3, which occurred earlier. The progression (1/6, 1/3, 1/2) has common difference 1/6.
