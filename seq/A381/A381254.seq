%N A381254 Decimal expansion of the obliquity (in radians) of a planet at which the annual instellations received by the poles and the equator are identical.
%C A381254 For an obliquity x, the normalized annual instellation coefficient at the equator is e(x) = (EllipticE(sin(x)^2) + sqrt(cos(x)^2) * EllipticE(-tan(x)^2)) / Pi, and at the poles is p(x) = sin(x), and the present constant is x where e(x) = p(x).
%C A381254 These coefficients are obtained by integrating over the sine of solar altitude over the course of one planetary year.
%C A381254 If the obliquity of a planet is greater than this value (for example, Uranus), then the poles would receive more instellation per year than the equator, which would result in a climate that inverts typical perceptions of those latitudes and the polar regions would be hotter than equatorial ones, in some cases resulting in an "ice belt" planet. However, these seasonal means would be accompanied by intense seasonal variations, as opposed to purely "tropical" polar regions.
