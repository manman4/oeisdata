%N A381380 Decimal expansion of the area of a ruled surface formed by moving a segment of length sqrt(6), the ends of which lie on the diagonals of opposite faces of a unit cube oriented at right angles to each other.
%C A381380 A segment of constant length continuously sliding its endpoints along two intersecting straight lines defines a ruled surface -- a linoid. Here we consider a linoid defined by a segment of length sqrt(6)/2 sliding along two intersecting diagonals of opposite faces of a cube with edge 1. The surface of a linoid is given by the equation 2*x^2/(z - 1/2)^2 + 2*y^2/(z + 1/2)^2 = 1.
%C A381380 The surface of a linoid consists of four congruent surfaces. The area of one of them is calculated using integrals and multiplied by 4.
%C A381380 The name of the figure "linoid" was introduced by the author in the related article, see link.
