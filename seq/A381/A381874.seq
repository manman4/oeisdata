%N A381874 Numbers whose set of divisors can be partitioned: a) into two disjoint subsets with equal sums and cardinalities, and b) into two disjoint subsets with equal products and cardinalities.
%C A381874 If y is a term of this sequence, then so is p*y, where p is a prime that is coprime to y.
%C A381874 It seems that the maximum first difference is 24.
%e A381874 Let D be the set of the divisors of 24, i.e. {1,2,3,4,6,8,12,24}. On the one hand (sums) D = {1,2,3,24} union {4,6,8,12}. On the other hand (products) D = {1,2,12,24} union {3,4,6,8}. So, 24 is a term.
