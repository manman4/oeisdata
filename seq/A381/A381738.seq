%N A381738 Numbers k such that k^2 is abundant.
%C A381738 First differs from its subsequence A363171 at n = 21: a(21) = 68 is not a term of A363171.
%C A381738 First differs from its subsequence A334166 at n = 204: a(204) = 585 is not a term of A334166.
%C A381738 A334166 is a subsequence because if k is in A334166, then there is a divisor d of k such that d*k is a Zumkeller number, so d*k is abundant (because all the Zumkeller numbers are abundant), and since d*k is a divisor of k^2 then k^2 is also abundant.
%C A381738 Equivalently, numbers k such that d*k is abundant for at least one divisor d of k.
%C A381738 The least odd term is a(36) = 105.
%C A381738 The least term that is coprime to 6 is a(12519603) = 37182145.
%C A381738 If k is divisible by 6, 10 or 14, then it is a term. Therefore a lower bound for the asymptotic density of this sequence is 19/70 = 0.271... .
%C A381738 The numbers of terms that do not exceed 10^k, for k = 1, 2, ..., are 2, 33, 347, 3403, 33728, 336599, 3368889, 33628998, 336480309, 3365049432, ... . Apparently, the asymptotic density of this sequence exists and equals 0.336... .
%C A381738 If k is a term then any positive multiple of k is a term. The primitive terms are in A381739.
