%N A381631 Numbers k such that the product of k and its digits is divisible by the sum of its digits.
%C A381631 Positive integers with the digit 0 (see A011540) are terms, since the product of it and its digits is A098736(k) = 0 which is divisible by any sum of digits.
%C A381631 Terms with a 0 digit form various runs of consecutive terms, such as from 100...00 through to 111...10.
%C A381631 Terms without a 0 digit can form runs of 9 terms: see A381697.
%C A381631 A prime > 7 is never divisible by its sum of digits (because the sum is smaller than the prime) so that primes > 7 occur in this sequence only when their product of digits is divisible by sum of digits (the primes in A038367).
%e A381631 36 is a term because 36*3*6 is divisible by 3+6.
%e A381631 140 is a term because 140*1*4*0 equals 0, which is trivially divisible by 1+4+0.
