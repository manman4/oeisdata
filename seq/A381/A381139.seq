%N A381139 a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2. Let j = a(n-1) and let d = A160995(j) be the smallest non-divisor of j which shares a prime factor with j. Then for n > 2 a(n) is the smallest multiple of d which is not yet in the sequence.
%C A381139 2 is the only prime in the sequence. Initially every odd term > 1 is a multiple of 9.
%C A381139 The first 3 odd terms not divisible by 9 are the following: a(19241) = 25, a(38481) = 75, a(57719) = 125, a(76959) = 175, a(115438) = 275. Differences between indices of odd terms divisible by 25 but not 9 are approximately 19240.
%C A381139 In this sequence, 25 follows 55440 = 2^4 * 3^2 * 5 * 7 * 11. The number 49 is missing for n <= 2^24.
%C A381139 Though a(n+1) must neither divide a(n) nor be coprime to same, a(n) may divide a(n+1). Examples: the sequence begins with {1, 2, 4}, a(19) = 27 and a(20) = 54, a(44) = 63 and a(45) = 126, etc.

%e A381139 a(3) = 4, the smallest non divisor of 2 which shares a divisor with 2.
%e A381139 a(4) = 6, the smallest non divisor of 4 which shares a divisor with 4.
%e A381139 a(5) = 8 because 4 is the smallest non divisor of 6 with a factor in common but 4 has been seen earlier and 8 is the least novel multiple of 4.
%e A381139 a(10) = 24 implies a(11) = 9 since A160995(24) = 9, and 9 has not occurred earlier. This is the first odd number in the sequence. Thereafter we see a(19) = 27, a(36) = 45, a(44) = 63, a(61) = 81, etc (consecutive odd multiples of 9). It is not known if this behavior continues as the sequence extends.
