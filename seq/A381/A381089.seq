%N A381089 Number of binary relations on n unlabeled points without isolated points.
%C A381089 Equivalently, the number of simple digraphs on n unlabeled two-colored nodes where each node is connected to at least one other node.

%F A381089 a(n) = A000595(n) - Sum_{i=1..n} (i+1)*a(n-i).
%e A381089 For n = 2 there are 10 (=A000595(2)) - 3 (=number of relations with isolated points) = 7 = a(2) relations.
%e A381089 For n = 3 there are 104 (=A000595(3)) - 2 * 7 (=number of relations with exactly one isolated point) - 3 * 0 (=number of relations with exactly two isolated points) - 4 * 1 (=number of relations with exactly three isolated points) = 86 = a(3) relations.
