%N A381339 Number of vector differences between two permutations of order n, up to multiplication by nonzero rational numbers and permutations of the components.
%C A381339 Nonzero difference vectors are associated with their images in the projective space, and in addition we do not distinguish vectors that can be permuted one into the other. In the affine space, their number (including zero vector) is given by A019589, implying that a(n) <= A019589(n). Nonzero difference vectors in the projective space are counted by A381243.
%e A381339 For n = 3, there are A019589(3) = 5 difference vectors up to permutation of components: (-2, 0, 2), (-2, 1, 1), (-1, -1, 2), (-1, 0, 1), and (0, 0, 0). However, (-2, 0, 2) and (-1, 0, 1) are the same up to a factor 2, and (-2, 1, 1) and (-1, -1, 2) are the same up to negation and reversing the order. Hence, a(3) = 3.
%Y A381339 Cf. A019589, A175176, A362968, A381243, A381244.
