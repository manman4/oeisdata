%N A381848 Sequence obtained by replacing 3-term subwords of A010060 by 0,1,2,3,4,5 as described in Comments.
%C A381848 The six 3-term subwords of A010060 are 0,0,1; 0,1,0; 0,1,1; 1,0,0; 1,0,1; 1,1,0. These are coded as 0,1,2,3,4,5 respectively, and then these numbers replace the corresponding subwords in A010060. The positions of 0,1,2,3,4,5 are given by A248956, A248104, A157971, A157970, A248105, A248057, respectively.
