%N A381699 a(n) is the least nontrivial multiple of 2*n with the least possible number of even digits.
%C A381699 By nontrivial multiple, we mean a multiple strictly larger than the number.
%C A381699 For even numbers, the last digit of any multiple will always be even. Also, for multiples of 10^k, all multiples will always have at least k even digits, namely k trailing '0's. Thus, if the number is a multiple of 2*10^k, there will be at least k+1 trailing even digits.
%C A381699 Question: if n is even, but not a multiple of 10, is there always a multiple k*n for which the last digit is the only even digit? If not, what is the smallest counterexample?
%C A381699 Records values of k(n) = a(n)/2n are k(1) = 2, k(5) = 3, k(7) = 4, k(11) = 5, k(21) = 8, k(45) = 11, k(58) = 12, k(101) = 55, k(182) = 108, k(1001) = 555, k(2001) = 778, k(3996) = 1001, k(7992) = 3253, k(9091) = 21545, k(9901) = 161155, ...
%e A381699 a(4) = 16 is the least nontrivial multiple of 8 with only one even digit.
%e A381699 a(5) = 30 is the least nontrivial multiple of 10 with only one even digit.
%e A381699 a(10) = 40 because 40 is the least nontrivial multiple of 20, and all multiples of 20 will always have (at least) the last two digits even.
%e A381699 a(41) = 574 is the least positive multiple of 82 that has only one even digit.
