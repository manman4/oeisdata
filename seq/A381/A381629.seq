%N A381629 Lexicographically earliest sequence of positive integers such that no subsequence of terms at indices in arithmetic progression form an arithmetic progression in any order.
%C A381629 First differs from A361933 at a(52).
%C A381629 This is a variant of A361933 generalized to arithmetic progressions of any nontrivial length (3 or greater).

%e A381629 a(52) cannot be values 1-7 without creating an arithmetic progression. a(52) cannot be 8 because the terms at i = 22,32,42,52 (common difference 10) would have the terms 5,11,2,8, which, rearranged, form the progression 2,5,8,11 (common difference 3). a(52) cannot be 9 because the terms at i = 38,45,52 (common difference 7) would have the terms 5,1,9, which in the order 1,5,9 form an arithmetic progression (common difference 4). So a(52) = 10.
%Y A381629 Cf. A361933.
