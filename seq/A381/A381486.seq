%N A381486 Number of labeled histories for rooted ternary trees with 2n+1 leaves if simultaneous trifurcations are allowed.
%C A381486 a(n) is also the number of single-elimination sports tournament schedules possible for 2n+1 teams if matches involve three teams, arbitrarily many arenas are available, and labeled teams have been specified, but the bracket of matches has not been specified.

%F A381486 a(n) = Y(2n+1), where Y(n) = Sum_{i=1..floor(n/3)} (n!/(i!*6^i*(n-3*i)!))*Y(n-2*i), with Y(1)=1.
%e A381486 Consider 7 named players in a sport in which players compete 3 at a time (e.g. the television gameshow "Jeopardy!"). The number of ways a single-elimination tournament can be arranged, if simultaneous matches can take place, is a(3)=420. Three of these 420 are: (1) A, B, and C play; the winner plays against D and E; the winner plays against F and G. (2) D, E, and F play; the winner plays against A and B; the winner plays against C and G. (3) A, B, and C play simultaneous with D, E, and F; the winners of these matches play against G.
