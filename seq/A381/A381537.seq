%N A381537 Lexicographically least sequence of natural numbers such that for all arithmetic progressions p, length(p) <= sqrt(max(p)).
%C A381537 Up to a(n) the longest possible arithmetic progression is sqrt(a(n)).
%C A381537 Does the density of this sequence approach 1?

%e A381537 1 is in the sequence, as 1 creates the arithmetic progression p = {1}, where length(p) = 1 and sqrt(max(p)) = 1.
%e A381537 For 2: the arithmetic progression p = {1,2} would be created. Here, length(p) = 2, and sqrt(max(p)) = sqrt(2), so length(p) > sqrt(max(p)), thus 2 is not in the sequence. Similarly, 3 is not in the sequence.
%e A381537 For 4: p = {1,4} is the only new arithmetic progression. Here, length(p) = 2, and sqrt(max(p)) = 2, so 4 is in the sequence. Similarly, 5 is in the sequence.
%e A381537 For 6: the arithmetic progression p = {4,5,6} would be created. Here, length(p) = 3, and sqrt(max(p)) = sqrt(6), so length(p) > sqrt(max(p)), thus 6 is not in the sequence.
