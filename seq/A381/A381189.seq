%N A381189 Ulam numbers that are squarefree semiprimes.
%C A381189 Ulam numbers: a(1) = 1; a(2) = 2; for n>2, a(n) = least number > a(n-1) which is a unique sum of two distinct earlier terms.
%C A381189 Number such as 4, 2809, 3481, 6889, etc., are in A378795 but not in this or in a longer sequence.
%e A381189 4 is not a term of this sequence because 4=2^2 is the product of 2 not distinct primes even if 4 is an Ulam number.
%e A381189 6 is a term because 6=2*3 is the product of 2 distinct primes and 6 is an Ulam number.
%e A381189 57 is a term because 57=3*19 is the product of 2 distinct primes and 57 is an Ulam number.
%e A381189 2809 is not a term of a longer sequence because 2809=53^2 is the product of 2 not distinct primes even if 2809 is an Ulam number.
