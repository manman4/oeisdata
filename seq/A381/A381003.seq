%N A381003 Lexicographically earliest sequence with a(0) = 0 and a(n) = a(n + a(n)) - a(n - a(n)) > 0.
%C A381003 A trivial but not lexicographically earliest solution for this problem is given by a(m) = ceiling(m/2) (A110654).
%C A381003 We assume a(<0) = 0 in this definition but conjecture that a(n) < n for n > 1.
%C A381003 If we iterate recursively k_{n+1} = a(k_{n})+k_{n} starting with k{0}=2, then we will observe a monotone increasing trajectory. An interesting consequence of the existence of this sequence is that if we start a trajectory at some k{m} > 2, such a trajectory would in the majority of cases ( or in all such cases? ) merge into the trajectory which is starting at 2.
