%N A381865 Number of sequences in which the matches of a fully symmetric single-elimination tournament with 3^n players can be played if arbitrarily many matches can occur simultaneously and each match involves 3 players.
%C A381865 a(n) is also the number of tie-permitting labeled histories for a fully symmetric strictly trifurcating labeled topology with 3^n leaves.

%e A381865 Two of the 13 cases with n=2 and 3^2=9 players are: (1) (A,B,C) play, then (D,E,F) play, then (G,H,I) play, then the winners of the three matches play; (2) (A,B,C) play simultaneously with (D,E,F), then the winners of these two matches play against G, then the winner plays against H and I.
%Y A381865 Cf. A273723 (if matches must be non-simultaneous), A379758 (if matches involve only two players at a time).
