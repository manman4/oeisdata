%N A381586 Number of simple graphs on n unlabeled vertices whose degree sequence is consecutive.
%C A381586 A graph has a consecutive degree sequence if its distinct degrees are consecutive integers. This includes all regular graphs.

%e A381586 For n = 4 there are 11 non-isomorphic graphs G on 4 vertices. An example with consecutive degree sequence is 4K_1, with degree sequence 0000; and an example with non-consecutive degree sequence is K_1 U K_3 with degree sequence 0222. The only other G with non-consecutive degree sequence is K_{1,3} with degree sequence 1113. Thus a(4) = 9.
