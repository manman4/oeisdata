%N A381402 Numbers k such that the set P of bases and exponents in the prime factorization of k (including exponents = 1) contains all numbers from min(P) to max(P).
%e A381402 48 is a term because 48 = 2^4*3^1, the set of these bases and exponents is {1, 2, 3, 4} and this set contains all numbers from 1 to 4.
%e A381402 2000 is a term because 2000 = 2^4*5^3, the set of these bases and exponents is {2, 3, 4, 5} and this set contains all numbers from 2 to 5.
