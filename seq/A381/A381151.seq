%N A381151 The order of the 13 cards of one suit such that after Down-SpellUnder dealing the cards are in order; a(n) is the n-th card in the deck.
%C A381151 Number 1 corresponds to ace, 11 to jack, 12 to queen, and 13 to king.
%C A381151 In the Down-SpellUnder deal, we first deal out a card, and then put a card from the top of the deck underneath for each letter in the name of the dealt card. So if the first card in the deck is an ace, after dealing it out we cycle 3 cards under for each letter in A-C-E, and then we deal the next card. This sequence is the unique permutation of 13 numbers such that, if the cards of one suit begin in this order, they are dealt in increasing order.

%e A381151 The first card dealt is an ace, following which the jack (i.e., 11), the 4, and the 6 are placed under the deck (for A-C-E). Then, the next card is dealt, which is 2. If we continue this process, the cards are dealt in order.
