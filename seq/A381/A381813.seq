%N A381813 Number of connected components, not counting isolated vertices, of the blet graph for n coins.
%C A381813 The blet graph for n coins has one vertex for each binary heads/tails-sequence of length n. Two vertices are connected by an edge if there is a legal move between them in the game of blet, i.e., if one can be obtained from the other by replacing one occurrence of a triple THT with HTH. The binary sequences are circularly connected, so such a triple is allowed to start at one of the last two elements of the sequence and continue from the beginning.
%C A381813 The number of isolated vertices is A007039(n).
%C A381813 A075273(n) is the size of the component containing (HT)^n in the blet graph for 2*n coins.

%e A381813 For n = 4, the blet graph has A007039(4) = 6 isolated vertices TTTT, TTHH, THHT, HTTH, HHTT, HHHH, and a(4) = 2 components of size at least 2: {TTTH, THTT, THHH, HTHT, HHTH} and {TTHT, THTH, HTTT, HTHH, HHHT}.
