%N A381462 Limiting sequence of the possible number of inversions in stable configurations of 3^n-1 chips in a chip firing-game directed 3-ary tree resulting from a permutation-based strategy of firing chips.
%C A381462 Consider a 3-ary, rooted infinite directed tree where each vertex has outdegree 3. Consider the chip firing game on this tree defined in Section 2 of Inagaki, Khovanova, and Luo (2025) with 3^n chips, which are labeled 0, 1, 2, ..., 3^n-1, at the root vertex.
%C A381462 Let A(3, n) be the increasing sequence of all possible numbers of inversions in stable configurations in a chip-firing game on a 3-ary tree starting with 3^n chips resulting from applying a permutation-based strategy corresponding to permutation w of 1,2,..., n. In the strategy, for each i = 1, 2, ..., n, chips with j as the w_i-th most significant digit are sent to the (j+1)-st leftmost child of the fired vertex. For each n, divide each element in A(3, n) by 9^n and put the resulting elements in order from smallest to greatest. These are the first several terms of the sequence.
%C A381462 This sequence is defined at the end of Section 4.3 of "Permutation-based Strategies for Labeled Chip-Firing on k-ary Trees."
