%N A381749 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k), n >= k, is the maximum number of kings on a n X k chessboard so that no king attacks more than one other king.
%C A381749 Two kings attack each other if their corresponding cells have a common point.
%C A381749 Define a graph G = (V,E), where V is the set of kings and E includes all pairs of attacking kings. Then the constraint is equivalent to all connected components of G having 1 or 2 kings. Denote the connected components of G by blocks.
%C A381749 Extend the board P to P' by adding a row at the bottom and a column at the right. Define the neighborhood of a block B as the union of the 2 X 2 squares whose upper-left corner is a cell in B.
%C A381749 The neighborhoods of permitted blocks are shown, with B marked by 'X' and the remaining part of B's neighborhood by '-':
%C A381749  X-  XX-  X-  X--   X-
%C A381749  --; ---; X-  -X-  X--
%C A381749           --; ---; -- .
%C A381749 Suppose that a cell C is in the neighborhoods of two distinct blocks B1 and B2. Then B1 and B2 both have a cell in the 2 X 2 square whose lower-right corner is C, but these two cells must be neighbor to each other, a contradiction.
%C A381749 Therefore, the neighborhoods of all blocks in P are non-overlapping in P'. Note that the size of a block's neighborhood is at least three times the size of the block. That is, T(n,k) <= (n+1)*(k+1)/3.
%C A381749 Also, note that 2 X 6 and 3 X 6 boards can be tiled with 6-sized neighborhoods, so m X 6 boards, where m > 1, can also be tiled with 6-sized neighborhoods. Therefore, the remaining details are not tedious to work with since a n X k board can generally be reduced to a (n mod 6) X (k mod 6) board.
