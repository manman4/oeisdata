%N A381849 Intersection of A025487 and A242298.
%C A381849 This sequence properly includes the deeply composite numbers (A095848). 36 and 180 are the first terms of this sequence that are not deeply composite.
%e A381849 Once we get to 60, all succeeding terms in the sequence must be divisible by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. However, not all multiples of 60 that are less than 420 (LCM(1,...,7)) have least prime signature, so 300 is excluded. All other multiples of 60 between 60 and 420 have least prime signature, so they are terms of this sequence.
