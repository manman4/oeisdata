%N A381769 a(n) is the area of the largest rectangle that can be formed from n sticks whose lengths are 1, 2, ..., n.
%C A381769 For k >= 0 and n = 8k, 8k+1, 8k+6, or 8k+7, a(n) is a square.
%C A381769 For k >= 1 and n = 8k+2, 8k+3, 8k+4, or 8k+5 , a(n) is a rectangular number of the form m*(m+1) for some m.
%C A381769 The cases not covered are n = 2, 3, 4, and 5.
%C A381769 For n >= 5 the solutions follow a predictable pattern.
%C A381769 For n >= 5 and (n≡0 mod 4 or n≡3 mod 4) all sticks contribute to the rectangle.
%C A381769 For n >= 5 and (n≡1 mod 4 or n≡2 mod 4) there is portion of length 1 that does not contribute to the rectangle, as in the example below.
%C A381769 Theorem 1: For n >= 13, a(n) = (floor(sqrt(a(n-8)))+2*n-7)*(ceiling(sqrt(a(n-8)))+2*n-7). For proof see link.
%C A381769 From _M. F. Hasler_, Mar 10 2025: (Start)
%C A381769 Theorem 2: Let n = 8k + r > 4 with k = round(n/8), and let L = k*(n + r + 1) = k*(8k + 2r + 1). Then
%C A381769   a(n) = L^2 if -3 < r < 2 or else L*(L+1) if r = 2 or -3, or else (L+1)*(L+2).
%C A381769 Proof: If n = 8k, we can form 4 sets of equal sum by adding the numbers from n down to 1 one after the other to one of the sets that has the lowest sum. For example, put 8 through 5 into sets A, B, C, D, then 4 through 1 must go into D, C, B and finally A. That way, after every 8 additions, the sum of the elements of each set will be the same. The average number added is (n+1)/2, and each set receives 2*k numbers, so the common sum is L = k*(n+1) = k*(8k + 1), and we can form a square of area a(n) = L^2.
%C A381769 Similarly, if n = 8k + r with r < 8, we proceed in the same way, starting with n and doing k iterations of 8 "additions", the last of which is r+1, when {1, ..., r} remain. Thus, so far, the average of the added numbers is (n + r+1)/2, and the common sum is now L = k*(n + r+1) = k*(8k + 2r+1).
%C A381769 If r = 1, then there remains only {1}. This "unit stick" can be added to any set but won't help for making a larger square, so still a(n) = L^2, with L = k*(8k + 3).
%C A381769 If r = 2, there remains {1, 2}. Adding these to two distinct sets allows to make a rectangle of area a(n) = L*(L+1) where now L = k*(n + 3) = k*(8k + 5).
%C A381769 The reasoning also applies for r = -1: For example, when n = 7, the sets will be {7}, {6, 1}, {5, 2}, {4, 3}. We can actually imagine a 0 added in the last step, to explain the average value (n+0)/2 of the 2k numbers that each set receives, for a common sum of L = k*n. The four sets of equal sum L correspond to a square of area a(n) = L^2, L = k*n = k*(8k - 1).
%C A381769 Now consider r = -2, for example n = 6: The sets will be {6}, {5}, {4, 1}, {3, 2} when nothing is left. We see that three sets again have the usual sum L = k*(n - 1) = k*(8k - 3), and one set has a sum of L+1, which doesn't help to make a larger area: again, a(n) = L^2 in this case.
%C A381769 For n = 8k - 3, two sets will still have the usual sum L = k*(n - 2) = k*(8k - 5), but two sets will have a sum of L+1 and L+2, respectively. (For n = 5, we get {5}, {4}, {3}, {2+1}.) So we can make a rectangle of area a(n) = L(L+1).
%C A381769 For n = 8k - 4, if we distribute all numbers, we have one set with the usual sum L = k*(n-3) = k*(8k-7), but the others have a sum of L+1, L+2 and L+3, respectively. For n = 4, we have {4}, {3}, {2}, {1}, and the best we can make is a rectangle of area a(4) = 1*3 = 3. But if k > 1, we can rearrange the terms to get a larger area: When only {4, 3, 2, 1} remain, we exchange 5 and 6 and add 4, 3, 2, 1 in turn to the set with smallest sum. For example, {12, 5}, {11, 6}, {10, 7}, {9, 8} becomes {12, 6, 1}, {11, 5, 4}, {10, 7, 3}, {9, 8, 2} with sums 19, 20, 20, 19. This way we get an area of a(n) = (L+1)(L+2) for all k > 1.
%C A381769 For n = 8k + 3, after k iterations, the sets have the sum L = k*(n + 4) = k*(8k + 7), and {1, 2, 3} remains. For example, when n = 11, L = 11+4 = 10+5 = 9+6 = 8+7 = 15. If we exchange again 5 and 6 and distribute 1, 2 and 3 to the sets with sums L and L-1, we get two sets with sum L+1 and two with sum L+2. Thus, a(n) = (L+1)(L+2).
