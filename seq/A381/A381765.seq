%N A381765 Number of connected simple graphs on n unlabeled vertices whose degree sequence is consecutive.
%C A381765 A connected graph has a consecutive degree sequence if its distinct degrees are consecutive integers. This includes all connected regular graphs.

%e A381765 For n = 4 there are 6 non-isomorphic connected graphs G on 4 vertices. An example with consecutive degree sequence is P_4, the path on 4 vertices, with degree sequence 1122; and an example with non-consecutive degree sequence is the star K_{1,3} with degree sequence 1113. All other connected G have consecutive degree sequence. Thus a(4) = 5.
