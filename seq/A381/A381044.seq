%N A381044 Primes prime(k) followed by a gap, prime(k+1)-prime(k), smaller than the local geometric average gap between consecutive primes: log(prime(k))/e^(gamma).
%C A381044 Primes prime(k) such that log(prime(k+1)-prime(k)) < log(log(prime(k)))-gamma, where log is the natural logarithm and gamma is Eulerâ€™s constant (A001620).
%C A381044 Except for terms less than 41, A001359 (Lesser of twin primes) is a subsequence. From 41, the first term not included is 1279.
%C A381044 It has been conjectured that primes are distributed around their average spacing in a Poisson distribution (cf. D. A. Goldston and A. H. Ledoan). This is the basis of the conjecture that, for k tending to infinity, the asymptotic limit of the average of log(prime(k+1)-prime(k)) is log(log(prime(k))) - gamma (where gamma is Euler's constant). Also, the geometric mean of the gap between consecutive primes [p(k+1)-p(k)] is equivalent to log(prime(k)) / e^gamma.

%e A381044 29 is not a term because log(31-29) > log(log(29))-0.5772156649, i.e.: 0.693147 > 0.636894.
%e A381044 41 is a term because log(43-41) < log(log(41))-0.5772156649, i.e.: 0.693147 < 0.734779.
