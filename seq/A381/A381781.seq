%N A381781 a(n) = k where k*Pi is the solution to sin(x) = 0 obtained using Newton's method starting from x = n.
%C A381781 Each step of Newton's method for this is x -> f(x) = x - tan(x).
%C A381781 If |x - k*Pi| < A381473 = 1.16556... for some k then each step takes x closer to k*Pi (by absolute difference) and so converges on the multiple k*Pi.
%C A381781 If n itself is within |n - k*Pi| < A381473 then that convergence to k*Pi begins with the initial x = n and in that case a(n) = round(n/Pi) = A082964(n).
%C A381781 The width of this convergence region around each k*Pi is 2*A381473 = A257451 = 2.331... so contains at least 2 integers n and so every k >= 0 occurs at least twice in the sequence.
%C A381781 When x (or n) is further from its nearest multiple of Pi, the slope of sin(x) sends a step off to possibly much bigger or smaller places on the real line and may converge on some k*Pi far from the initial n.
%C A381781 Those steps can be large enough to reach negative k, as for example first at a(99) = -810 (see A381892 and A381893).
%C A381781 Conjecture: Infinitely many negative integers appear.

%F A381781 a(n) = (1/Pi)*lim_{k->oo} f_k(n), where f_k(n) denotes the k-th iteration of the function f(x) = x - tan(x).
%e A381781 a(11) = 74: applying Newton's method to f(x) = sin(x) with initial guess x_0 = 11 gives x_1 = 236.9508, x_2 = 232.8538, etc., eventually converging to x = 232.477856365644 with a(11) = x/Pi = 74.
