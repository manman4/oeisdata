%N A381472 Number of unlabeled set systems on n vertices which are closed under union of disjoint sets.
%C A381472 A set system is a finite set of finite nonempty sets.
%C A381472 a(n) is also the number of non-isomorphic sets of subsets of an n-set which are closed under union of disjoint sets and which include the empty set.
%e A381472 Non-isomorphic representatives of the a(2) = 5 set-systems:
%e A381472   {}
%e A381472   {{1}}
%e A381472   {{1,2}}
%e A381472   {{1},{1,2}}
%e A381472   {{1},{2},{1,2}}
%e A381472 The a(3) = 22 non-isomorphic set-systems include A193674(3) = 19 set-systems that are closed under union and 3 additional set-systems which do not include {1,2,3}:
%e A381472   {{1,2},{1,3}}
%e A381472   {{1},{1,2},{1,3}}
%e A381472   {{1,2},{1,3},{2,3}}
