%N A381856 Lexicographically earliest sequence of positive integers such that for any value k, no two sets of two or more indices at which k occurs have the same standard deviation.
%C A381856 A382381 gives the indices of 1s in this sequence.
%C A381856 If the definition is modified to compare all sets of indices whose terms are equal (not just those sets with the same value k), we get A337226.

%e A381856 a(13) = 3: a(13) cannot be 1 as i = 4,13 would have the same standard deviation as i = 1,4,8,13 (namely 4.5). We cannot have a(13) = 2 because i = 3,6 would have the same standard deviation as i = 10,13 (namely 1.5). With a(13) = 3, we find that no two subsets of i = 7,9,12,13 have the same standard deviation, so a(13) = 3.
