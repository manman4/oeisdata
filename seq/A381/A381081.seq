%N A381081 Lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct positive integers such that the string value of a(n) begins with a divisor of a(n-1).
%C A381081 The sequence contains many fixed points, these beginning 1, 22, 23, 40, 41, 52, 199, 1936, 1937, 1938, 1939, ... .

%e A381081 a(2) = 10 as the only divisor of a(1) = 1 is 1, and 10 is the smallest unused number to begin with 1.
%e A381081 a(43) = 53 as a(42) = 106 whose divisors are 1, 2, 53, 106, and 53 is the smallest unused number to begin with 53 - all other smaller numbers beginning with 1 and 2 have been used. This is the first term to differ from A248024.
