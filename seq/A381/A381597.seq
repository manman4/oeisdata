%N A381597 Lexicographically earliest sequence of positive integers such that for any t and k, with k>=1, where t = a(n) = a(n+k) = a(n+2*k), only one occurrence of k, for a given t, appears anywhere in the sequence.
%C A381597 See A381599 for the index where n first appears, and A381598 for the index where three consecutive n's appears.

%e A381597 a(1) = a(2) = a(3) = 1, which is the first appearance of three 1's separated by one term.
%e A381597 a(4) = 2 as 1 cannot be chosen as that would form a(2) = a(3) = a(4) = 1, but three 1's separated by one term has already appeared.
%e A381597 a(5) = 1, which also forms three 1's separated by two terms, a(1) = a(3) = a(5) = 1.
%e A381597 a(17) = 3 as 1 cannot be chosen as that would form a(15) = a(16) = a(17) = 1, but three 1's separated by one term has already appeared, while choosing 2 would form a(11) = a(14) = a(17) = 2, but three 2's separated by three terms has already appeared at a(4) = a(7) = a(10) = 2.
