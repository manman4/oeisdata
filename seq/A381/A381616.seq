%N A381616 a(n) is the smallest prime that starts the first occurrence of exactly n consecutive primes in A381019.
%C A381616 As the sequence grows, increasingly longer chains of consecutive prime numbers begin to appear.
%C A381616 Conjecture: a(n) always exists.
%e A381616 For n = 2, we observe that 9, 31, 37, and 8 are four consecutive terms of A381019, where 31 and 37 are exactly two consecutive primes and represent the first occurrence of two consecutive terms that are prime. So, a(2) = 31.
