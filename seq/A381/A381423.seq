%N A381423 Exponent of x of maximal coefficient in Hermite polynomial of order n.
%C A381423 The exponent is always unique. The coefficients, in absolute value, follow a unimodal pattern, and their signs alternate. If the maximum absolute coefficient appears twice due to symmetry (e.g., H_8(x)), the terms will have opposite signs, ensuring a unique exponent for the maximum signed coefficient.
%C A381423 Conjecture: Differences are either 1 or -3; more specifically the patterns (1,1,1,-3) or (1,1,1,1,-3), with position of those patterns appearing at linearly and quadratically spaced intervals, respectively. Seems to grow O(n^(1/2))
%e A381423 For n = 5, H_5(x) = 32*x^5 - 160*x^3 + 120*x. The maximal coefficient is 120 (we take signs into account, so -160 < 120), occurring at x^1, hence a(5) = 1.
