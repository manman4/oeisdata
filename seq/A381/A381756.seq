%N A381756 Decimal expansion of the smallest angular distance between two vertices of the equilateral square antiprism measured along the circumscribing sphere.
%C A381756 The equilateral square antiprism of side number n=4, lateral edge length a, and the two bases separated vertically by h has h = a*sqrt( 1-sec^2(Pi/(2n)) ) = a/2^(1/4). The 4 vertices of the top base have Cartesian coordinates (+-a/sqrt(2),0,h/2), (0,+-a/sqrt(2),h/2); the 4 vertices at the bottom base have (+-a/2,+-a/2,-h/2). The common distance of these 8 vertices from the origin is r = a*sqrt(8+2^(3/2))/4, the radius of the circumscribing sphere. The largest dot product between pairs of the 8 vertices is sqrt(2)*a^2/8 , which is equivalent to the smallest distance measured along the surface of the sphere of radius r. Dividing this dot product through r^2 gives 2^(3/2)/(8+2^(3/2)), the cosine of the angle between closest vertices. This here is the angle measured in radians.
