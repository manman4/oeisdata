%N A381811 The largest nonnegative integer j for which each integer n,n+2,...,n+2j can be written as the sum of the squares for some partition of n.
%C A381811 a(n) has an asymptotic equivalence with (1/2)*n^2-sqrt(2)*n^(3/2)+O(n^(5/4)) (Reznick 1989, p. 201).

%F A381811 a(n) = (A383682(n) - n) / 2.
%e A381811 a(3) = 1, because n, n+2 (3 and 5) can be written as the sum of the squares for some partition of n; 3=1^2+1^2+1^2 and 5=2^2+1^2. However, 7 cannot be written as the sum of squares of the parts of a partition of 3, so a(3) = 1.
%e A381811 a(4) = 3, because n, n+2, n+4 and n+6 (4, 6, 8 and 10) can be written as the sum of the squares for some partition of n; 4=1^2+1^2+1^2+1^2, 6=2^2+1^2+1^2, 8=2^2+2^2, and 10=3^2+1^2. However, 12 cannot be written as the sum of squares of the parts of a partition of 4, so a(4) = 3.
