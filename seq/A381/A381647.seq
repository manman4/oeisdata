%N A381647 Centered triangular numbers that are deficient.
%C A381647 Centered triangular numbers a(n) = 3*n*(n-1)/2 + 1 are the sum of three consecutive triangular numbers (A000217).
%e A381647 10 is a term in the sequence because 10 = 3*3*2/2 + 1 is the 3rd centered triangular number and is a deficient number since it is larger than the sum of its proper divisors (8).
%e A381647 19 is a term in the sequence because 19 = 3*4*3/2 + 1 is the 4th centered triangular number and is a deficient number since it is larger than the sum of its proper divisors (1).
%e A381647 5491 is a term in the sequence because 5491 = 3*61*60/2 + 1 is the 61st centered triangular number and is a deficient number since it is larger than the sum of its proper divisors (649).
