%N A381731 a(n) is the least number k with squarefree neighbors such that the number of non-unitary divisors of k (A048105) is equal to n, or 0 if no such k exists.
%C A381731 From _Amiram Eldar_, Mar 06 2025: (Start)
%C A381731 For odd k a(k) is a square. a(9) = 0 because for a square m we have tau(m) >= 3^omega(m). Since A048105(m) = tau(m) - 2^omega(m) = 9, we have 2^omega(m) + 9 >= 3^omega(m) so omega(m) = 1.
%C A381731 Because m^2-1 is squarefree, m must be even, so with omega(m) = 1, we have m = 2^k and with tau(2^k) = 2^1 + 9 = 11 we get k = 10, m = 1024. But 1025 is not squarefree. Therefore a(9) = 0. (End)
