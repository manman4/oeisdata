%N A381495 a(n) is the number of times n appears in A381466.
%C A381495 The sequence is well defined, as we have proven that A381466(n) > sqrt(n/6) for all n, and thus each number can only appear a finite amount of times in A381466.
%C A381495 It appears that this sequence has an average value of approximately 1.755
