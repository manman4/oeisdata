%N A381894 Lexicographically earliest sequence of positive integers such that a(n) is the length of the n-th run of consecutive, equal terms and no two runs have the same sum.

%e A381894 a(6) = 3 because the 4th run must have length a(4) = 1, and the potential runs 1 and 2 have the same sum as a run already in the sequence (namely 1 and 1,1). So a(6) = 3 since no run has appeared with a sum of 3 thus far.
