%N A381678 a(n) is the least exponent k such that there are exactly n 1's in the decimal expansion of 11^k, or -1 if no such k exists.
%C A381678 If instead of the least exponent, one looks at the greatest exponent, then b(n) ~ n/0.1
%C A381678 Define f(x) to be the number of exponents k which have x ones in the decimal expansion of 11^k. Then f(x) = 1 for x = {0, 9, 10, 14, 17, 20, 23}.
%C A381678 It is provable that a(0) = -1 using the expansion of (x+y)^n. Conjecture: a(n) = -1 for n = 18622, 62206, 74453, 133125, etc. Search limit was k=1.5*10^6.
%e A381678 a(1) = 0 since 11^0 = 1 has one occurrence of the decimal digit 1.
%e A381678 a(2) = 1 since 11^1 = 11 which has just two decimal digits of 1;
%e A381678 a(3) = 5 since 11^5 = 161051 which has just three decimal digits of 1;
%e A381678 a(4) = 11 since 11^11 = 285311670611 which has just four decimal digits of 1; etc.
