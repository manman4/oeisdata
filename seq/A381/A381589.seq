%N A381589 The number of face-magic cubes with magic sum n and distinct positive integers at the vertices including 1.
%C A381589 The face-magic cubes counted here have 8 distinct positive integers (including 1) at the vertices, and each sum over the 4 vertices of the 6 faces is the same. Cubes obtained by rotations or mirrors of the octahedral point group are counted only once.

%e A381589 The 3 face-magic cubes with sum 18 are 1 4 5 8 - 6 7 2 3, 1 4 5 8 - 7 6 3 2 and 1 6 3 8 - 7 4 5 2, values at the base and values at the top face separated by a dash.
