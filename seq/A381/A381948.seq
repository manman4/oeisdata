%N A381948 Number of sequences in which the matches of a fully symmetric single-elimination tournament with 4^n players can be played if arbitrarily many matches can occur simultaneously and each match involves 4 players.
%C A381948 a(n) is also the number of tie-permitting labeled histories for a fully symmetric strictly quadfurcating labeled topology with 4^n leaves.

%e A381948 Two of the 75 cases with n=4 and 4^2=16 players are: (1) (A,B,C,D) play, then (E,F,G,H) play, then (I,J,K,L) play, then (M,N,O,P) play, then the winners of the four matches play; (2) (A,B,C,D) play simultaneously with (E,F,G,H) and (I,J,K,L), then the winners of these three matches play against M, then the winner plays against N, O, and P.
%Y A381948 Cf. A273725 (if matches must be non-simultaneous), A379758 (if matches involve only two players at a time), A381865 (if matches involve only three players at a time).
