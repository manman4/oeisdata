%N A361388 Number of orders of distances to vertices of n-dimensional cube.
%C A361388 Let C be an n-dimensional cube and p be a point in R^n such that the distances from p to the 2^n vertices of C are all different. List the vertices in order of their distance from p. The number of different orders of vertices is given by a(n).
%C A361388 Equality of any two distances defines a hyperplane in R^n, although different pairs of distances may define the same hyperplane. All these hyperplanes partition the space into cells, and the interior of each (n-dimensional) cell corresponds to a particular strong order of the differences. Hence, a(n) equals the number of cells in the partition of R^n by the hyperplanes. The given SageMath code implements this approach. - _Max Alekseyev_, Mar 10 2023
%C A361388 Computing the sequence is slow. The Sage program took 20 minutes to compute a(5) on Lucas Brown's box; the C++ program took 3.5 seconds to compute a(5) on Pierre Abbat's box, a 12-thread Ryzen. The C++ program took 6 hours to compute a(6). Neither of us has computed a(7) with the program; that's from A009997.
%C A361388 For n >= 4 the frequencies of the orders appear to vary widely.

%F A361388 a(n) = 2^n*n!*A009997(n).
%e A361388 For n=3, a 3-dimensional cube has 8 corners, numbered 0 to 7. A point can be closest to any of the 8 corners. A point closest to 0 can have distances to corners 1, 2, and 4 in any of 6 orders. A point whose distances to corners 0, 1, 2, and 4 are in increasing order can be closer to 3 than to 4, or closer to 4 than to 3. So the total number of orders is 8*6*2=96.
