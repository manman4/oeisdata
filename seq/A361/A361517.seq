%N A361517 The value of n for which the two-player impartial {0,1}-Toggle game on a generalized Petersen graph GP(n,2) with a (1,0)-weight assignment is a next-player winning game.
%C A361517 The two-player impartial {0,1}-Toggle game is played on a simple connected graph G where each vertex is assigned an initial weight of 0 or 1.
%C A361517 A Toggle move consists of selecting a vertex v and switching its weight as well as the weights of each of its neighbors. This move is only legal provided the weight of vertex v is 1 and the total sum of the vertex weights decreases.
%C A361517 In the special case G=GP(n,2), a (1,0)-weight assignment is one in which each vertex of the outer polygon is assigned weight 1 and each vertex of the inner polygon(s) is assigned weight 0.
