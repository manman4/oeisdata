%N A379102 Number of fundamentally distinct graceful labelings in a maximally graceful tree with n vertices.
%C A379102 Values appearing in Fig. 6 of Anick (2016) count subtractively complemented labelings separately and so must be divided by 2 to obtain what are conventionally considered "fundamentally distinct" labelings (i.e., distinct both with respect to the symmetry of the graph *and* subtractive complementation with respect the edge count of a graph).
