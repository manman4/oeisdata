%N A379654 Least positive integer k <= n such that |tau(k)|*n + 1 is prime, or 0 if such k does not exist, where the tau function is given by A000594.
%C A379654 Conjecture 1: a(n) > 0 for all n > 0. In other words, for each positive integer n, there is a number k among 1,...,n such that |tau(k)|*n + 1 is prime.
%C A379654 Conjecture 2: For each integer n > 1 not equal to 22, there is a number k among 1,...,n such that |tau(k)|*n - 1 is prime.
%C A379654 We have verified both conjectures for n up to 10^8.

%e A379654 a(1) = 1 since 1*|tau(1)| + 1 = 2 is a prime.
%e A379654 a(5) = 5 since 5*|tau(5)| + 1 = 5*4830 + 1 = 24151 is prime, and 5*|tau(k)| + 1 is composite for every k = 1, 2, 3, 4.
