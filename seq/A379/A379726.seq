%N A379726 Minimum number of kings that must be placed on an n X n chessboard such that each square is attacked or occupied by at least two kings.
%C A379726 At most one king can be placed on each square.
%C A379726 Every third term is conjectured to be A014105. Other terms are A001105. A093353 is conjectured to be this sequence with repeated terms removed.
%C A379726 The above conjectures are true (see Beveridge link). - _Colin Beveridge_, Jan 13 2025
