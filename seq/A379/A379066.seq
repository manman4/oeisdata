%N A379066 Indices in A377091 where there is a record upward jump from a negative term to a positive term.
%C A379066 These are the indices of record (positive) high points in A379061.
%C A379066 The k-th high point corresponds to a jump in A379061 of height approximately k^2. These heights (whose square roots are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, ...) do not warrant an OEIS entry of their own.

%e A379066 The third term, 9, corresponds to the jump at the 9th term in A377091 from A377091(9) = -3 to A377091(10) = 6. (The fact that this is a jump of 9 = 3^2 is just a coincidence.)
%e A379066 The fourth term, 20, corresponds to the jump of height 25 = 5^2 at the 20th term in A377091 from A377091(20) = -12 to A377091(21) = 13.
