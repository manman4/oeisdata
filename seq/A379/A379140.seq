%N A379140 Numbers k such that the greatest prime < 10^k and the least prime > 10^k share no decimal digits.
%C A379140 Charles R Greathouse IV conjectures that A107801(n) = prime(n) for n sufficiently large (and similarly for other related sequences). If that is the case, this sequence must be finite.

%e A379140 a(3) = 8 is a term because the greatest prime < 10^8 and the least prime > 10^8 are 99999989 and 100000007 respectively, and these have no digits in common.
%e A379140 5 is not a term because the greatest prime < 10^5 and the least prime > 10^5 are 99991 and 100003 respectively, and these have digit 1 in common.
