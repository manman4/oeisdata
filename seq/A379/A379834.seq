%N A379834 Positive integers with digits in nondescending order whose digit product is an integer power of their digit sum, given power > 1.
%C A379834 This sequence would include the terms of A274124 (digit product equal to digit sum) if the power were allowed to be 1.
%C A379834 This sequence is similar to A117720 (digit product is the square of the digit sum) except that powers > 2 are also included, and that A117720 does not require nondescending digits. These results are from empirical observation.
%C A379834 Each number of this sequence is an element of a group of permutations of its digits.
%C A379834 Since both addition and multiplication are commutative, it is only necessary to select one representative member of each digit permutation group. The member with digits in nondescending order is chosen.
