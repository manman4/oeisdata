%N A379505 a(n) is the number of ways of partitioning the divisors of n into two disjoint sets with equal sum, when an extra 1-divisor is added to the divisor set, and the two 1-divisors are considered indistinguishable.
%C A379505 Conjecture 1: For all n >= 1, a(A156942(n)) > 0. Also, if a(A156942(n)) > 1 is true for all n, it would imply that there are no quasiperfect numbers, numbers x with sigma(x) = 2x+1, as such numbers must all reside in A156942 and have a(x) = 1. (See references in A336700).
%C A379505 Conjecture 2: a(n) = 1 if and only if n = 2^k, with k >= 0. This claim is equal to the statement that there are neither quasiperfect numbers nor almost perfect (least deficient) numbers, numbers x with sigma(x) = 2x-1, others than those given by A000079.

%F A379505 a(n) <= A379504(n).
%F A379505 A103977(n) = 1 <=> a(n) > 0.
%e A379505 a(18) = 2 as its divisor set with an extra 1 is [1, 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18], and this can be partitioned to two sets with equal sums either as 1+1+3+6+9 = 2+18 or as 2+3+6+9 = 1+1+18.
%e A379505 a(36) = 5 as its divisor set with an extra 1 is [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36], and this can be partitioned in any of the following five ways, when two 1's are considered indistinguishable:
%e A379505   1+1+2+6+36  = 3+4+9+12+18,
%e A379505   1+2+3+4+36  = 1+6+9+12+18,
%e A379505   1+3+6+36    = 1+2+4+9+12+18,
%e A379505   1+9+36      = 1+2+3+4+6+12+18,
%e A379505   4+6+36      = 1+1+2+3+9+12+18,
%e A379505 where each sum on the left and right hand side gives (sigma(36)+1)/2 = 46.
%e A379505 There are 42 partitions of (sigma(72)+1)/2 = 98 into the divisors of 72, [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 72], with an extra 1 allowed:
