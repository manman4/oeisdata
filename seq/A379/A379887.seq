%N A379887 Number of rational polygons with denominator at most n having exactly one lattice point in their interior, up to equivalence.
%C A379887 A379894 counts the polygons with the extra condition that the vertices are primitive. Both are in Classification 5.6 of the article by Bohnert and Springer.
%C A379887 An algorithm to compute a(n) was given by Timo Hummel in his dissertation. His final number for n = 3 (given in Theorem 12.1) was however slightly off.
