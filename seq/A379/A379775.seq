%N A379775 a(1) = 2. For n > 1, a(n) = smallest prime factor of c=2*a(n-1)-1 that is not in {a(1), ..., a(n-1)}; if all prime factors of c are in {a(1), ..., a(n-1)}, then we try the next value of c, which is 2*c-1; and so on.
%C A379775 The following are some statistics about how many terms of the sequence are required, so that the first k primes are included:
%C A379775 - The first 10^2 terms include the first 28 primes.
%C A379775 - The first 10^3 terms include the first 92 primes.
%C A379775 - The first 10^4 terms include the first 710 primes.
%C A379775 - The first 10^5 terms include the first 4848 primes.
%C A379775 - The first 10^6 terms include the first 29442 primes.
%C A379775 - The first 10^7 terms include the first 260324 primes.
%C A379775 Conjecture: this sequence is a permutation of the primes.

%e A379775 a(6) is 7 because the prime factors of c=2*a(5)-1 (i.e., 21) are 3 and 7, and 3 already appears in the sequence as a(2).
%e A379775 a(8) is 97 because the only prime factor of c=2*a(7)-1 (i.e., 25) is 5 which already appears in the sequence as a(3). The next value of c (i.e., 2*c-1) is 49; its only prime factor is 7 which already appears in the sequence as a(6). The next value of c (i.e., 2*c-1) is 97, which is prime and does not already appear in the sequence.
