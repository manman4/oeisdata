%N A379271 Composite numbers, k, whose prime factors, viewed on a log log scale, have a small standard deviation defined with respect to bigomega(k), as specified in the comments.
%C A379271 Composite numbers k (written as a product of primes p_1 * p_2 * ... * p_m) such that s( {log(log(p_i)) : 1 <= i <= m} ) < s( {i : 1 <= i <= m} ), where s is standard deviation and m = bigomega(k).
%C A379271 Loosely described, these are numbers whose prime factors, including repetitions, are relatively close together. (Note we get the same criterion irrespective of whether s is sample standard deviation or population standard deviation.)
%C A379271 The author's intent is to divide the set of composite numbers into 2 parts whose asymptotic densities differ at most by a small factor. So his choice of criterion was guided by particular information relating to the statistics of prime factors of large numbers.
%C A379271 From _Charles R Greathouse IV_, May 19 2025: (Start)
%C A379271 For example, semiprimes p*q with p <= q are in this sequence if (and only if) q < p^e where e = 2.71... is the base of the natural logarithm.
%C A379271 For any m, there are finitely many primes p (perhaps none) such that p*m is in the sequence. (End)
