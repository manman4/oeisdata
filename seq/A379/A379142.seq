%N A379142 Lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct positive integers such that the sum of terms a(1)..a(n) has no digit in common with the sum of digits in the terms a(1)..a(n).
%C A379142 The majority of terms are approximately n, but some terms show dramatic jumps in value, e.g. a(499) = 999999212. This is due to the term sum reaching the next order of magnitude which only contains a leading nonzero digit followed by all zero digits, with the digit sum containing neither of these digits. As this is always possible regardless of the length of the sequence it is likely the sequence is infinite in length and contains all positive integers.

%e A379142 a(1) = 11 as the sum of terms up to a(1) is 11 while the sum of digits is 2, and 2 shares no digit with 11.
%e A379142 a(5) = 5 as the sum of terms a(1)..a(5) is 22 while the sum of digits of these terms is 13, and 13 shares no digit with 22.
