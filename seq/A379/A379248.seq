%N A379248 a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2, for a(n) > 2, a(n) is the smallest unused positive number that shares a factor with a(n-1) while no exponent of each distinct prime factor of a(n) is the same as the exponent of the same prime factor of a(n-1).
%C A379248 For the terms studied the primes appear as terms in their natural order, and when a prime p appears as a term, the preceding term is always p^2 and the following term is always 2*p^2; it is likely this is true for all primes. A similar pattern is seen in the EKG sequence A064413 except that there a prime is always preceded by 2*p and followed by 3*p.
%C A379248 Unlike the EKG sequence a prime can appear as a factor of a preceding term long before it appears as a term by itself - see A379291 for the indices where each prime first appears as a factor of a(n).
%C A379248 The indices where the primes appear show an interesting pattern of runs of consecutive primes that are separated by only 6 terms, with longer, sometimes much longer, gaps in between - see A379290 and A379296. These primes appear in regions where the terms overall show a strong oscillating pattern of jumping between terms containing a prime p and p^2 as a factor. The primes being oscillated between increase until a new prime q appears in a term q^2 which leads to the next term being q. The occurrence of a new prime q can start a run of consecutive primes appearing before these oscillations subside and the terms slowly grow again until the next oscillation. See the attached graphs which show the burst/oscillating behavior, with the primes appearing in these regions, followed by terms with a slow, more linear, growth.
%C A379248 In the first 500000 terms there are only six fixed points - see A379292. However, as the regions of oscillating terms crosses the a(n) = n line it is likely more exist for larger values of n.
%C A379248 The sequence is conjectured to be a permutation of the positive integers. See A379293 for the index where n first appears.

%e A379248 a(3) = 4 as 4 is unused and shares a factor with a(2) = 2, while 4 = 2^2 which has 2 as the exponent of the prime 2, while a(2) = 2^1 which has exponent 1. As these are different 4 is acceptable.
%e A379248 a(5) = 8 as 8 is unused and shares a factor with a(4) = 6, while 8 = 2^3 which has 3 as the exponent of the prime 2, while a(4) = 2^1*3^1 which has exponent 1. As these are different 8 is acceptable. Note that although 3 shares a factor with 6, 3 = 3^1 which has the same exponent 1 on the prime 3 as 6 = 2^1*3^1, so 3 cannot be chosen. This is the first term to differ from A064413.
