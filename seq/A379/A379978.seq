%N A379978 a(n) is the smallest positive integer which can be represented as the sum of its prime divisors in exactly n ways, or -1 if no such integer exists.
%C A379978 a(31) > 26000, if it is not -1. - _Michael S. Branicky_, Jan 08 2025
%C A379978 From _Yifan Xie_, Jan 09 2025: (Start)
%C A379978 a(31) = -1. Proof:
%C A379978 Lemma: n can be partitioned into a and b (gcd(a, b)=1) if n>ab-a-b. Proof: Using Bezout's theorem we can get n = xa+yb for integers x and y. Substitute x'=x-kb for x and y'=y+ka for y such that 0 <= x' <= b-1, then y'>-1, so y'>=0, a valid partition.
%C A379978 Suppose that a(31)=n has 3 distinct prime divisors p<q<r, and a valid partition is n=ap+bq+cr. Using the lemma, ap+bq has at least one partition if n-cr>pq-p-q. so c<(n+p+q-pq)/r, hence there are at least (n+p+q-pq)/r choices for c, but there are at most 31 partitions, thus 31r >= n+p-q(p-1) >= n-r*(p-1) >= r*(pq+1-p), p*(q-1) <= 30, and r <= 30 since there are r+1 partitions of pqr into p and q. Enumerate all possibilities of p, q, r and only (p,q,r) = (2,3,5) and (2,3,7) give no more than 31 partitions. But in these cases, if n=pqr, there are fewer than 31 partitions; if n >= 2pqr, there are more than 31 partitions.
%C A379978 If a(31) = n has exactly 2 prime divisors p, q, it's easy to see that n has n/(p*q) + 1 partitions into p and q. therefore n = 30*p*q, a contradiction. If a(31) = n is prime, n has only 1 partition. (End)
