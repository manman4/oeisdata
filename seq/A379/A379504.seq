%N A379504 a(n) is the number of ways of partitioning the divisors of n into two disjoint sets with equal sum, when an extra 1-divisor is added to the divisor set, and the two 1-divisors are considered distinct from each other.
%C A379504 A379505 is a variant where two 1's are considered indistinguishable. See comments there.

%e A379504 a(18) = 2 as its divisor set with an extra 1 is [1_a, 1_b, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18], and this can be partitioned to two sets with equal sums either as 1_a+1_b+3+6+9 = 2+18 or as 2+3+6+9 = 1_a+1_b+18.
%e A379504 a(36) = 8 as its divisor set with an extra 1 is [1_a, 1_b, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36], and this can be partitioned in any of the following ways:
%e A379504    1_a + 1_b + 2 + 6 + 36    = 3 + 4 + 9 + 12 + 18,
