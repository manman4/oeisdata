%N A379051 Lexicographically earliest infinite sequence of distinct positive numbers with the property that n is a member of the sequence iff a(n) is composite.
%C A379051 The sequence tells you exactly which terms of the sequence are composite: the second, fourth, fifth, sixth, etc. terms are composite, and this is the lexicographically earliest sequence with this property.
%C A379051 Let P be a property of the nonnegative integers, such as being a prime.
%C A379051 The OEIS contains many entries whose definitions have the following form.
%C A379051 "The sequence is the lexicographically earliest infinite sequence of distinct positive (or sometimes nonnegative) integers with the property that n is a term of the sequence iff a(n) has property P."
%C A379051 That is, the terms of the sequence tell you which terms of the sequence have the property. A121053 is the classical example.
%C A379051 Since these are lists, the offset is usually 1.
%C A379051 There are two versions, one where the sequence is required to be strictly increasing, and an unrestricted version which is not required to be increasing.
%C A379051 Examples:
