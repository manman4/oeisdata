%N A379713 Array read by downward antidiagonals: rows list practical numbers with the same progenitor primitive practical number (A267124).
%C A379713 A permutation of the practical numbers.
%C A379713 This sequence is presented as an array of rows. The first row contains a single term of value 1. Subsequent rows are infinite sequences and are presented as a square array by listing the antidiagonals downwards that is 1: 2; 4,6; 8,12,20; etc.
%C A379713 The first column contains the primitive practical numbers A267124; each row lists all practical numbers (A005153) having the same primitive practicle progenitor and which is the first term in each row. See A379325 comments for further details. If T[1,m] is squarefree then the row is identical to the same squarefree row in A284457.
%C A379713 Every primitive practical number A267124(n) is the progenitor of a disjoint subsequence of the practical numbers. If the PP column represents the sequence of primitive practical numbers A267124, the table below give the 7 initial terms of the disjoint sequences of practical numbers A005153 generated by the initial 7 terms of the sequence of primitive practical numbers.
%C A379713 PP: Disjoint subsequence of A005153
