%N A379474 Number of prime factors of the form p^e || n : [p == 1 (mod 8), e == 1 (mod 4)] or [p == 5 (mod 8), e == -1 (mod 4)].
%C A379474 In the definition p^e || n indicates that p^e divides n, but p^(1+e) does not divide n.
%C A379474 In Prasad and Sunitha paper prime factors of the form {p^2e : [p == 1 (mod 8), e == 1 (mod 4)] or [p == 5 (mod 8), e == -1 (mod 4)]} are called "special factors", and it is shown there that a necessary condition for an odd primitive abundant square (A379949) to be a quasiperfect number (number x such that sigma(x) = 2x+1) is that it has an odd number of such factors.

%e A379474 a(17) = 1 because 17 is of the form 8m+1 and its exponent 1 is of the form 4m+1.
%e A379474 a(697) = 2, as 697 = 17^1 * 41^1, a product of two primes of the form 8m+1 with exponents of the form 4m+1.
%e A379474 a(2125) = 2 because 2125 = 17^1 * 5^3, the first factor is a prime of the form 8m+1 with exponent of the form 4m+1, and the second factor is a prime of the form 8m+5 with exponent of the form 4m+3.
%e A379474 a(50881) = 3 as 50881 = 17^1 * 41^1 * 73^1, a product of three primes of the form 8m+1 with exponents of the form 4m+1.
