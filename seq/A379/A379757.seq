%N A379757 a(n) = a(n-1) + 1 with two exceptions: if a(n-1) is prime, a(n) = a(n-2) + a(n-1), or if a(n-1) is a power, a(n) = a(n-1) / (root factor), with initial three terms are 0, 1, 2.
%C A379757 The construction rules are very basic, but lead to somewhat surprising results. Terms that are perfect powers are extremely rare (only n=6,7 so far). Additionally, the sequence is nearly all composites. Comparing to A000045, eight early distinct terms are in common, but it is unclear when another intersection is seen.
%F A379757 Conjecture: log(a(n)) ~ k*sqrt(n).
%e A379757 We know a(1)=0, a(2)=1, a(3)=2. Since a(3) is prime, a(4)=a(2)+a(3)=3. Since a(4) is prime, a(5)=a(3)+a(4)=5. Similarly, a(6)=a(4)+a(5)=8. Since a(6) is a perfect power, a(7) = a(6)/2 since 8=2^3. Since a(7)=4 is another perfect power, a(8)=4/2=2. Since a(8) is prime, a(9)=a(7)+a(8)=6. For clarity, if a(n-1) = r^k, then a(n) = a(n-1)/r.
