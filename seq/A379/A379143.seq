%N A379143 Lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct positive integers such that both the sum of terms a(1)..a(n) and the sum of the digits in these terms is a prime number.
%C A379143 As the sum of terms beyond a(2) = 3 must be odd, a(2) is the only odd term. It is unknown if all even numbers appear.
%C A379143 Similarly, the sum of digits of terms beyond a(2) must be odd, so a(2) is the only term with odd sum of digits. 10 is the first even number that does not appear. - _Michael S. Branicky_, Dec 18 2024

%e A379143 a(5) = 4 as the sum of both the terms and digits from a(1)..a(5) is 23, which is a prime number, and 4 has not previously appeared.
%e A379143 a(6) = 24 as the sum of terms from a(1)..a(6) is 47 while the sum of digits of these terms is 29, and both 47 and 29 are prime numbers while 24 has not previously appeared.
