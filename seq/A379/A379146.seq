%N A379146 Numbers k that are not in A378930 (i.e., are never the value of f(n) = n * d(n) / gcd(n, d(n))^2, where d = A000005).
%C A379146 Verified using the known values of f(n) up to a limit determined by the upper bound for divisor function 2*sqrt(n). The lower bound for f(n) is n/d(n), which can be combined with d(n) <= 2*sqrt(n) to yield f(n) >= sqrt(n)/2, and n <= 4*f(n)^2. E.g. for f(n) = 18, this means that checking f(n) for n <= 1296 is sufficient to verify it's never the value of f(n).
%C A379146 It appears that all numbers 9*p, p prime, are in this sequence.
