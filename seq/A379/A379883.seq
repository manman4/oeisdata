%N A379883 a(1) = 1. Let j = a(n-1) and r = A046144(j). Then for n > 1, if j is novel and r > 0, a(n) = r. If j is novel and r = 0 then a(n) = 1. If j has occurred k (>1) times already then a(n) = k*j.
%C A379883 In other words if j = a(n-1) has not occurred earlier and has r (> 0) primitive roots then a(n) = r. Cases where novel A046144(j) = 0 cannot be counted multiplicatively (as k*j) for repeats, so a(n) = 1 is designed to permit the sequence to continue past such points, which means including in the count of 1's terms following (1,2,3,4,6), for which it is true that r = 1. Terms beyond a(12) = 8 which count the number of 1's (by the second condition) give the cardinality of terms with no primitive roots, plus the few (5) cases of terms with primitive root = 1.
%C A379883 Every even number m in A380594 appears finitely many times, consequent to occasions of integers v (>6) for which A046144(v) = m, and to repetitions (k*j) = m for j even. However every odd number appears once only (consequent to odd counts of 1's). The odd numbers appear in order, and since 2 precedes all of them, the primes are in order.

%e A379883 a(2) = 1 since a(1)=1 and and 1 has one primitive root. Since 1 has been seen twice, a(3) = 2 and then a(4) = 1 since 2 is a novel term with one primitive root.
%e A379883 a(9) = 5, a novel term with two primitive roots so a(10) = 2, which has appeared once before (a(3)=2), so a(11) = 4, the second occurrence of 4 so a(12) = 8, a novel term with no primitive roots, meaning that a(13) = 1. The count of 1's is now 6, so a(14) = 6, meaning 5 prior terms with one primitive root and one with none.
