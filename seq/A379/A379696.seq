%N A379696 Number of n-node combinatorial game trees in normal form.
%C A379696 A combinatorial game tree has the form {A,B,... | C,D,...}, where A,B,C,D,... are game trees. We can define addition, negation and a preorder on the game trees as described in Winning Ways (or Wikipedia on surreal numbers). We can simplify a game tree by deleting dominated moves or bypassing reversible moves. Thus we say that a game tree is in normal form if there are no dominated or reversible moves at any node of the tree.
%C A379696 A move from G to A of Left is dominated if they have a move from G to B such that B >= A (B is better for Left than A).
%C A379696 A move from G to A of Left is reversible if Right can respond with a move from A to X such that X <= G (X is better for Right than G).
%C A379696 Dominated and reversible moves are defined symmetrically for Right.
%C A379696 In Winning Ways pp.76-77, Berlekamp et. al. prove that any two normal forms that are equal (x <= y and y <= x) are isomorphic; any move in x has an equivalent move in y and vice versa. Thus the normal forms are the simplest representative for each equivalence class of game trees under equality.
