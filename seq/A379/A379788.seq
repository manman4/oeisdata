%N A379788 Sequence Sa of the eight sequences defining the blocks of terms in A377091.
%C A379788 For this discussion let R(n) (n >= 0) denote A377091(n). Sequence A377091 starts with R(0) = 0. From then on the sequence consists of blocks of consecutive terms all with the same sign. The blocks are defined by eight sequences denoted by Sa, Sb, ..., Sh. The (2k-1)-st block (k >= 1) consists of positive terms running from R(Sa(k)) = Sb(k) to R(Sc(k)) = Sd(k). This is followed by the (2*k)-th block (k >= 1) which consists of negative terms running from R(e(k)) = -Sf(k) to R(g(k)) = -Sh(k).
%C A379788 The sequences Sa, ..., Sh are Sa = A379788, Sb = A379789, Sc = A379790, Sd = A379791, Se = A379792, Sf = A379793, Sg = A380837, and Sh = A379794.
%C A379788 The sequences are related by Sa(k) = Sg(k-1)+1 and Se(k) = Sc(k)+1, and one of each pair could be omitted from the OEIS. However, since the structure of A377091 is already sufficiently confusing, at present all eight sequences have their own entries. This also makes it simpler to define the block lengths, etc., and to use the Plot2 OEIS command.
