%N A379233 Numbers k such that A003961(k) = 2k +- 3, multiplied by the sign of difference A003961(k)-2k, where A003961 is fully multiplicative with a(prime(i)) = prime(i+1).
%C A379233 6 is the only term that is in A104210, the absolute values of all other terms residing in its complement, A319630, thus 3 occurs only once in A379231. Proof: If k is not a multiple of 3 and k is in A104210, then there are primes p > 3 and q = nextprime(p) that both divide k and q also divides A003961(k). However, q does not divide 2k +- 3, therefore the equation 2k +- 3  = A003961(k) is unsolvable in these cases. So let's assume that k is a multiple of 3, which immediately entails that k must be also even, for A003961(k) to be a multiple of 3. Let x = k/6; then the equation can be rewritten as 2*6*x +- 3 = A003961(6)*A003961(x) <=> 12x +- 3 = 15*A003961(x) <=> 3*(4x +- 1) = 3*5*A003961(x). The only value of x that satisfies the equation is x=1 (as A003961(n)>n for all n>1), hence k=6.
%C A379233 If it exists, abs(a(15)) > 2^32.
