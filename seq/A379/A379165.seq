%N A379165 a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2; for n > 2, a(n) is the smallest unused positive number that is either coprime to both a(n-1) and a(n-2) or shares a factor with both a(n-1) and a(n-2).
%C A379165 For the terms studied the primes appear in their natural order. The fixed points being 3, 8, 10, 11, 18, 21, 26, 28, 29, 43, 51, 64... . After 10 million terms 3211449 of them, approximately 32.1%, share a factor with both previous terms - it is unknown what this ratio is as n -> infinity. The sequence is almost certainly a permutation of the positive numbers.
