%N A379424 Least modulus k such that the multiplicative group modulo k has a difference of n nontrivial cycles between its minimal and maximal representation.
%C A379424 This is equal to the least modulus k such that (Z/kZ)* has a representation as a direct product of cyclic groups, of which n are odd cycles. The number of even cycles in the maximal representation is equal to the total cycles in the minimal representation.
