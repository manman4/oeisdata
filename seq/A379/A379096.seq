%N A379096 Waterproof numbers >= 60.
%C A379096 All nonnegative numbers less than 60 are waterproof.
%C A379096 Zero and one are waterproof numbers by convention. Numbers that admit a prime factorization are waterproof if their water capacity is 0. (The water capacity of a number is defined in A275339.)
%C A379096 If the factors p_i^e_i in the canonical prime factorization of n are weakly ascending or weakly descending, then n is waterproof.
%C A379096 A number is waterproof if and only if it equals its waterproof hull (A379098). The waterproof hull h(n) of n is the smallest waterproof number that n divides.
%C A379096 Numbers that are not waterproof are listed in A379097.
%e A379096 Numbers having at most two distinct prime factors (A070915) are waterproof. The primorials (A002110) are waterproof.
%e A379096 48300 has a water capacity of 17 and so is not waterproof. The waterproof hull of 48300 is 1014300.
