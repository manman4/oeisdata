%N A379259 a(n) is the number of iterations that n requires to reach a 3-smooth number under the map x -> phi(x).
%C A379259 If k is a 3-smooth number then phi(k) is also a 3-smooth number. Therefore, a(n) counts the numbers that are not 3-smooth numbers in the trajectory from n to a 3-smooth number (including n if it is not a 3-smooth number).
%C A379259 The indices of records, 1, 5, 11, 23, 47, ..., seem to be A246491 except for the first term (checked up to A246491(15)).

%F A379259 a(A003586(n)) = 0.
%e A379259 a(1) = a(2) = a(3) = a(4) = 0 because 1, 2, 3 and 4 are already 3-smooth numbers.
%e A379259 a(5) = 1 because after one iteration 5 -> phi(5) = 4, a 3-smooth number, 4, is reached.
%e A379259 a(23) = 3 because after 3 iterations 23 -> 22 -> 10 -> 4, a 3-smooth number, 4, is reached.
