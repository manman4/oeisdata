%N A379163 Number of fixed site animals with n nodes on the nodes of the tetrakis square tiling.
%C A379163 Site animals on a lattice (regular graph) are connected induced subgraphs up to translation.
%C A379163 Dual to the site animals on the nodes of the truncated square tiling, counted by A197467, insofar as the tilings are each others' duals.
%C A379163 The Madras reference gives a good treatment of site animals on general lattices.
%C A379163 It is a consequence of the Madras work that lim_{n->oo} a(n+1)/a(n) converges to some growth constant c.
%C A379163 Terms a(1)-a(16) were found by running a generalization of Redelmeier's algorithm. The transfer matrix algorithm (TMA) is more efficient than Redelmeier's for calculating regular polyominoes, and may give more terms here too. See the Jensen reference for a treatment of the TMA. See the Vöge and Guttman reference for an implementation of the TMA on the triangular lattice to count polyhexes, A001207.

%F A379163 It is widely believed site animals on 2-dimensional lattices grow asymptotically to kc^n/n, where k is a constant and c is the growth constant, dependent only on the lattice. See the Madras and Slade reference.
%Y A379163 The platonic tilings are associated with the following sequences: square A001168; triangular A001207; and hexagonal A001420.
