%N A379381 a(1)=1, a(2)=2; thereafter, a(n) is the smallest positive integer such that for any value k, the number of distinct values between a pair of k's is distinct, counting k itself.
%C A379381 Note that we are considering every pair of equal values, not just those that appear consecutively.

%e A379381 a(7)=4: We cannot have a(7)=1 here because this would make a(1..7) = 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1 enclose the same number of terms as a(3..7) = 1, 2, 3, 3, 1 (3 distinct values). We cannot have a(7)=2 because this would mean a(4..7) = 2, 3, 3, 2 encloses 2 values, which we had at a(2..4) = 2, 1, 2. a(7) cannot be 3 because this would repeat a(5-6) = 3, 3 with a(6-7) = 3, 3, again enclosing 1 distinct value. So a(7) = 4 without restriction.
