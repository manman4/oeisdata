%N A379275 a(n) = A163801(n) mod 2.
%C A379275 Using Go language code found under Links, a search up to 10^9 terms counts irreducible missing binary words of lengths L = 1..20 as follows: [0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Relative to A379184, fewer omissions appear earlier and at more than one length.
%C A379275 A missing word is said to be irreducible if none of its subwords are missing.
