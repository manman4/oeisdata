%N A379730 a(1)=1. For n>1 if a(n-1) is a novel term a(n)=A083720(a(n-1)), else a(n) = k*a(n-1), where k(>1) is the number of times a(n-1) has occurred.
%C A379730 In other words if a(n-1) is a novel term, a(n) is the product of all primes < Gpf(a(n-1)) which do not divide a(n-1), else if a(n-1) seen k times already, up to and including itself then a(n)=k*a(n-1). All positive integers appear eventually in the sequence, and the first occurrences of primes appear in order.
%C A379730 Every squarefree number appears infinitely many times (consequent to both conditions of the definition), whereas numbers m which are not squarefree can appear only from the second condition, and therefore appear finitely many (at most A000005(m)-1) times; see Example.

%F A379730 If a(n-1) is a novel term and rad(a(n-1)) is primorial then a(n)=1.
%e A379730 a(1)=1 is a primorial term so a(2)=1. 1 has now occurred twice so a(3)=2*1=2.
%e A379730 a(3)=2 is a novel primorial term so a(4)=1, and then a(5)=3. Since 3 is novel a(6)=A083720(3)=2.
%e A379730 4 appears twice = A5(4)-1 (as 2*2=a(7), and 4*1=a(9)). It never appears again since A083720(m)!=4 for any m, so 4 can only arise as consequence of the second condition of the definition. Similarly 8 appears only 3 (A5(8)-1) times: 2*4=a(10), 8*1=a(21), and 4*2 a(47). However 16 appears not 5 (A5(16)-1) times but 4 times because 4*4 is prevented since 4 appears only twice.
