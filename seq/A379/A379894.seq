%N A379894 Number of rational polygons of denominator at most n having exactly one lattice point in their interior and primitive vertices, up to equivalence.
%C A379894 A rational polygon P of denominator d is said to have primitive vertices, if the lattice polygon d*P has primitive vertices.
%C A379894 A379887 counts the polygons without the condition that the vertices are primitive. Both are in Classification 5.6 of the article by Bohnert and Springer.
%C A379894 a(n) is also the number of isomorphism classes of 1/n-log canonical toric del Pezzo surfaces, see the article by H채ttig, Hausen, Hafner and Springer.
%C A379894 An algorithm to compute a(n) was given by Timo Hummel in his dissertation. His final number for n = 3 (given in Corollary 12.2) was however slightly off.
