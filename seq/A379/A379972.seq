%N A379972 Numbers x with 2^(m-1)<x<=2^m which can unambiguously be constructed with given points 0,1 on the x-axis and m circles.
%C A379972 Each circle, except for the last one, intersects the x-axis at the center of the next one. Any x>1 is represented by intersection points: y(1)=2, y(2),..., y(m)=x, but not necessarily in a unique way. The standard representation can be found by a backward algorithm: If y(j) is even, y(j-1)= y(j)/2, otherwise y(j)=(y(j)+1)/2. This way, only circles intersecting the x-axis at 0 or 1 are used. If no other representation exists, x belongs to the sequence, see examples.
%C A379972 Further comments, proof of the formula and images, see link "Construction with circles".

%F A379972 x=2^m-2^k+1 with m>=0 and 0<=k<=(m+1)/2.
%F A379972 For x=1, only m=0 makes sense. Therefore k=m=1 is excluded.
%e A379972 Example 1: k=0, x=2^m belongs to the sequence.
%e A379972  Standard repesentation: (2,..,2^j,..,2^m)
%e A379972 Example 2: m=6, k=3, x=57 belongs to the sequence.
%e A379972  Standard repesentation: (2,4,8,15,29,57)
%e A379972 Counterexample 3: m=6, k=4, x=49 does not belong to the sequence.
%e A379972  Standard repesentation: (2,4,7,13,25,49)
%e A379972  Other repesentation:    (2,4,7,14,28,49)
%e A379972 Counterexample 4: x=48 does not belong to the sequence.
