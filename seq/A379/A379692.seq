%N A379692 a(1) = 1; a(n) is the most recently occurring value not among the last k terms where k is the number of times a(n-1) has occurred; if no such value exists, a(n) is the smallest unused positive integer.
%C A379692 The number preceding and following each first occurrence is the same (with the exception of a(1)=1 which has no predecessor).

%e A379692 To find a(14)=4, we see that a(13) = 2 has occurred 3 times in the sequence, so the most recently occurring value before (5, 1, 2) which is not equal to 5,1,2 is a(9) = 4, so a(14) = 4.
