%N A379263 a(n) = n for 1 <= n <= 3. For n >3 a(n) is the smallest positive integer not already in the sequence which is prime to a(n-3) but not to a(n-2)*a(n-1).
%C A379263 Let i,j,k,h be any 4 consecutive terms, then there must be a prime p; p|j*k but p!|i, for if not then for any prime q;  q|j*k implies q|i. But then for any h such that gcd(h,j*k) > 1 we would have gcd(h,i) > 1; contradiction since h is a term. Any number of the form m = p*x where p|j*k, p!|i and x is any novel prime not dividing i must be a candidate for a(n) since then gcd(m,j*k) > 1 and gcd(m,i) = 1. Therefore the sequence is well defined and infinite. Similar to the Yellowstone sequence A098550, from which it diverges at a(8) = 5.
%C A379263 Conjecture: Sequence is a permutation of the positive integers, with primes in order.

%e A379263 Given a(1,2,3) = 1,2,3 a(4) = 4 since 4 it is the smallest novel number which shares a prime factor with 6 but not with 1. This forces a(5) = 9, the smallest number prime to 2 but not to 12.
%e A379263 a(21,22,23) = 11,55,20 so a(24) must be a multiple of either 2 or 5 since both divide 55*20 but not 11. Using 5 we would get a(24) = 30 or if using 2 we would have a(24) = 24. Thus a(24) = 24.
