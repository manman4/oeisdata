%N A379653 Primes p such that p == 1 (mod 4) and the Paley graph of order p is not alpha-critical.
%C A379653 For a prime p with p == 1 (mod 4), the Paley graph P_p is defined to have vertices 0,1,...,p-1, with vertices v,w adjacent if and only if the difference v-w is a quadratic residue mod p. A graph is alpha-critical if the removal of any edge increases the independence number of the resulting subgraph.

%e A379653 The Paley graph P_5 is the cycle on 5-vertices. P_5 is alpha-critical. So p=5 is not a term.
%e A379653 The first non-alpha-critical Paley graph is P_41 and thus the first term is 41.
