%N A379651 Decimal expansion of the smallest number greater than 1 whose decimal and binary expansions have the same succession of digits.
%C A379651 Equivalently, the binary expansion of the smallest number greater than 1 whose decimal and binary expansions have the same succession of digits.
%C A379651 The density of the digit 1 appears to approach 1/2.
%C A379651 Can anything be said about the nature of this number? Rational, irrational, algebraic, transcendental, etc.? Or about the positions of the 1's (see A379079)? - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Jan 11 2025
%C A379651 The number is irrational. Proof: Suppose that the number r = p/q is rational, where p and q are positive integers. Then the decimal and binary expansions of r eventually (from the m-th term) begin to repeat the same finite sequence of digits: a_1 a_2 ... a_k. Therefore the base 10 number can be expressed as a/10^(m-3) + b/(10^k-1), while the base 2 number can be expressed as c/2^(m-5) + d/(2^k-1), where a, b, c, d are integers. Denote the 2-valuation of a and c (i.e., the number of trailing zeros) by x (x < m-5). Hence the 2-valuation of the base 10 number is x-m+3, but the 2-valuation of the base 2 number is x-m+5, a contradiction. - _Yifan Xie_, Mar 15 2025
