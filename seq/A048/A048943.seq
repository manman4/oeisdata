%N A048943 Product of divisors of n is a square.
%C A048943 From _Gerard P. Michon_, Oct 10 2010: (Start)
%C A048943 If d is the number of divisors of N, a prime factor of N with multiplicity k in N has a multiplicity kd/2 in the product of all divisors of N (including N itself). Therefore the latter is a square if and only if kd/2 is always even (which is to say that kd is a multiple of 4 for any multiplicity k of a prime factor of N). This happens when one of the following three conditions hold:
%C A048943 - N is a fourth power (all the multiplicities are then multiples of 4 and d is odd).
%C A048943 - N has at least two prime factors with odd multiplicities.
%C A048943 - N has (at least) one prime factor with a multiplicity congruent to 3 modulo 4.
%C A048943 (End)
%C A048943 It follows from the comment above that if two terms are: a) even and odd, or b) terms of A006881, or c) terms of A000583, then their product is also a term. - _Ivan N. Ianakiev_, Jul 02 2023

%e A048943 a(1) = 1 because it's a fourth power. The product of all divisors of 1 is 1, which is a square.
%e A048943 a(2) = 6 because 2^1.3^1 is the product of two primes with odd multiplicities (1 in both cases). Indeed, the divisor product 1.2.3.6 = 36 is a square.
%e A048943 a(3) = 8 because 2 is a prime factor of 8 with multiplicity 3. Indeed, 1.2.4.8 = 64 is a square.
%e A048943 a(7) = 16 because it's a fourth power; 1.2.4.8.16 = 1024 is the square of 32. (End)
