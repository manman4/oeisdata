%N A328505 Numbers k such that there exist three rationals in arithmetic progression whose product is k.
%C A328505 Numbers k such that there exist rationals x, d such that k = x*(x^2-d^2).
%C A328505 Numbers k such that the elliptic curve s^3 + t^2 - k^2 has rational points other than (s,t) = (0, +/- k).  Namely, if (s,t) is a rational point on the curve with s <> 0, then we can take x=k/s, d=t/s.
%C A328505 If k is in the sequence, then so is j^3*k for any j.

%e A328505 a(5) = 10 is in the sequence because (1, 5/2, 4) are three rationals in arithmetic progression whose product is 10.
%e A328505 a(6) = 11 is in the sequence because (-9/2,-11/12,8/3) are three rationals in arithmetic progression whose product is 11.
