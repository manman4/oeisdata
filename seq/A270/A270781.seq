%N A270781 Numbers n with the property that n is both of the form p^2 + q^2 + r^2 + s^2 for some primes p, q, r, and s, and not of the form a^2 + b^2 + c^2 for any integers a, b, and c.
%C A270781 This sequence can easily be shown to be infinite. Take p, q, r equal and congruent to 1 mod 16, and s = 5. Then, because p = 1+16k, n = 28 + 96k + 768k^2, and n = 4*(7+8*m) for m = 3k+24k^2. Then, following from Legendre's three-square theorem, n cannot be written as a^2 + b^2 + c^2 for any a, b, c in the integers. Then, because there are infinitely many primes of the form p = 1+16k, this sequence is infinite.
%C A270781 It appears at first that all Mersenne numbers (A000225) are included in this sequence. However, this is not the case. The first counterexample is 262143 = 2^18 - 1. The next are 4194303 = 2^22 - 1 and 16777215 = 2^24 - 1.

%e A270781 31 = 2^2 + 3^2 + 3^2 + 3^2, and, according to Legendre's three-square theorem, 31 cannot be expressed as the sum of three squares, so 31 is a term.
