%N A156743 Month (3=March, 4=April) in which Easter occurs in Gregorian calendar year, starting with 1901.
%C A156743 From _Rick L. Shepherd_, Mar 09 2009: (Start)
%C A156743 Easter can never occur in March in two consecutive years. (See the Tondering link for information that was helpful in confirming this; especially, 2.13.9 "Is there a simple relationship between two consecutive Easters?" My (OpenOffice.org Calc BASIC) program found that the X-8 and X-9 cases mentioned there never occurred when beginning with Mar. 30th or Mar. 31st the first year.) However, Easter can occur in April in exactly 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, or 10 consecutive years (as seen by examining the entire 5700000-year Gregorian Easter cycle). The first year such that 10 consecutive years have the value 4 is 2856.
%C A156743 The <range> in the OpenOffice.org Calc spreadsheet array formula below is set to reference a set of cells containing the years of interest (Edit>Fill>Series Linear is useful for autofilling). The EASTERSUNDAY function is documented as accepting years from 1583 to 9956.
%C A156743 (A156743 as originally written (and extended here) should have offset 1901.) (End)
