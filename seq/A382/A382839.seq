%N A382839 Number of dense binary relations on {1,...,n}.
%C A382839 A binary relation R is usually called dense if for all R-related x and y there exists z such that x and z and also z and y are R-related (see Wikipedia link), but here we define a binary relation R on {1,...,n} to be "dense" (see the second page of the paper in the links) iff for all x and y we have (zRx implies zRy for all z) implies (x <= y).
%C A382839 Equivalently, as mentioned in a SeqFan post (see link), for all x < y, some z satisfies (not zRx) AND zRy.
%C A382839 Brendan McKay added terms for n = 6 and 7 in a SeqFan post (see link).
