%N A382128 Fractalization of the Recamán sequence.
%C A382128 Self-descriptive sequence: even indexed terms are the sequence itself, odd indexed terms are the Recamán sequence.
%C A382128 This is an r1k1 fractal sequence, where r1k1 means: remove 1 term, keep 1 term, repeat.  The Removed terms are the sequence that has been fractalized, and the Kept terms are the original fractal sequence.
%C A382128 This fractal sequence is not a Kimberling fractal sequence because if you delete the first occurrence of each term, the remaining sequence is not the same as the original. This sequence fails to be a Kimberling fractal due to having consecutive terms that both appeared earlier in the sequence, starting with the 1 and 42 at index 48 and 49, respectively.
