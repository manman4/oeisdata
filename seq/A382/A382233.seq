%N A382233 Dimensions of the homogeneous component of degree n of the free unital Jordan algebra on 3 generators.
%C A382233 First few terms coincide with A032120 but A032120(8) = 3321. This corresponds to the fact that A032120 gives dimensions of components of the free special Jordan algebra (which follows from Cohn 1959), and 3324 - 3321 = 3 is the dimension of the GL_3-orbit of the so called Glennie identity.
%C A382233 The terms up to a(12) were computed using the Albert nonassociative algebra system.

%e A382233 For n = 3, we have a(3)=18 since the following monomials form a basis: x(xx), x(xy), x(xz), x(yy), x(yz), x(zz), y(xx), y(xy), y(xz), y(yy), y(yz), y(zz), z(xx), z(xy), z(xz), z(yy), z(yz), z(zz), these are all commutative nonassociative monomials of degree 3, since the Jordan identity is of degree 4.
