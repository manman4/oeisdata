%N A382021 Number of distinct degree sequences among all simple graphs with n vertices whose degrees are consecutive integers.
%C A382021 A sequence of integers is consecutive if its distinct entries are consecutive integers, and a graphic sequence is a sequence of integers that can be the degree sequence of some graph. Thus a(n) is the number of consecutive graphic sequences of length n.

%e A382021 For n = 5 there are 34 non-isomorphic graphs G on 5 vertices, and 24 of these have a consecutive degree sequence. However consecutive degree sequences 11222, 12223, and 22233 each correspond to 2 non-isomorphic graphs. Thus there are 21 distinct consecutive graphic sequences of length 5, and so a(5)=21.
