%N A382129 Fractalization of the prime numbers.
%C A382129 Self-descriptive sequence: even indexed terms are the sequence itself, odd indexed terms are the prime numbers.
%C A382129 This is an r1k1 fractal sequence, where r1k1 means: remove 1 term, keep 1 term, repeat. The Removed terms are the sequence that has been fractalized, and the Kept terms are the original fractal sequence.
%C A382129 This fractal sequence is also a Kimberling fractal sequence because if you delete the first occurrence of each term, the remaining sequence is the same as the original.
