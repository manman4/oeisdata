%N A382238 a(n) is the smallest prime that begins a sequence of 2n + 1 consecutive primes where all even-indexed terms are balanced primes.
%e A382238 a(1) = 3, because u = [3,5,7] is a run of 2*1 + 1 = 3 consecutive primes such that u(2) = 5 is a balanced prime between the nearest primes, and no lesser prime has this property.
%e A382238 a(2) = 7817, because the sequence u = [7817, 7823, 7829, 7841, 7853] is a run of 5 consecutive primes (calculated as 2*2 + 1 = 5). In this sequence, u(2) = 7823 and u(4) = 7841 are balanced primes between the nearest primes.
