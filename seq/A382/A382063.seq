%N A382063 Numbers whose number of coreful divisors is divisible by their number of exponential divisors.
%C A382063 First differs from A377019 at n = 55: A377019(55) = 64 is not a term of this sequence.
%C A382063 First differs from A344742 at n = 62: A344742(62) = 72 is not a term of this sequence.
%C A382063 All the cubefree numbers (A004709) are terms. The least term that is not cubefree is a(215) = 256 = 2^8. The cubefree numbers are the terms whose number of coreful divisors is equal to their number of exponential divisors.
%C A382063 All the exponentially refactorable numbers (A382065) are terms. The least term that is not in A382065 is a(362) = 432 = 2^4 * 3^3. The next terms that are not in A382065 are 648, 2000, 2160, 3024, 3240, 4536, 4752, 5000, ... .
%C A382063 For a number k whose prime factorization is Product_{i} p_i^e_i, a coreful divisor d of k has the prime factorization Product_{i} p_i^f_i with f_i >= 1 for all i. An exponential divisor of k is a coreful divisor with the additional condition that f_i | e_i for all i.
%C A382063 Numbers k such that A049419(k) | A005361(k).
%C A382063 The criterion according to which a number belongs to this sequence depends only on the prime signature of this number: if {e_1, e_2, ... } are the exponents in the prime factorization of k then k is a term if and only if A005361(k)/A049419(k) = Product_{i} e_i/A000005(e_i) is an integer.
%C A382063 A number k is a term if and only if the cubefull part of k, A360540(k), is a term. Therefore, the primitive terms of this sequence are the cubefull terms, A382064.
%C A382063 The asymptotic density of this sequence is Sum_{n>=1} f(A382064(n)) = 0.83697905945047..., where f(n) = (1/(zeta(3)*n)) * Product_{prime p|n} (p^2/(p^2+p+1)).

%e A382063 2 is a term since A005361(2) = A049419(2) = 2, so 2 | 2.
%e A382063 256 is a term since A005361(256) = 8, A049419(256) = 4, and 4 | 8.
