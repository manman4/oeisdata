%N A382665 Number of distinct degree sequences among all connected simple graphs with n vertices whose degrees are consecutive integers.
%C A382665 A sequence of integers is consecutive if its distinct entries are consecutive integers, and a graphic sequence is a sequence of integers that is the degree sequence of some graph. Thus a(n) is the number of graphic sequences of length n that are consecutive and represent a connected graph.

%e A382665 For n = 5 there are 21 non-isomorphic connected graphs G on 5 vertices, and 16 of these have a consecutive degree sequence. However consecutive degree sequences 12223, and 22233 each correspond to 2 non-isomorphic connected graphs. Thus there are 14 distinct graphic sequences of length 5 that are consecutive and represent a connected graph, and so a(5)=14.
