%N A382803 Positive integers m such that phi(m) and phi(m+1) are both powers of 2.
%C A382803 Numbers m such that m and m+1 are in A003401
%C A382803 Each of m and m+1 must be a power of 2 times a product of Fermat primes.
%C A382803 Apart from term 5, odd terms are of the form 2^2^k - 1 for k in 0...5.
%C A382803 Even terms are exactly numbers of the form 2^2^k such that 2^2^k + 1 is a Fermat prime (A019434).
%C A382803 The sequence is thus infinite iff A019434 is infinite, i.e., iff there are infinitely many Fermat primes.

%e A382803 16 is present because phi(16) = 8 and phi(17) = 16, both powers of two.
%e A382803 17 is not present because phi(17) = 16 but phi(18) = 6, not a power of two.
%Y A382803 Cf. A000010, A000215, A003401, A019434, A051179, A382519 (odd terms).
