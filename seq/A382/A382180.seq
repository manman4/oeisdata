%N A382180 Number of unlabeled connected graphs with n vertices which are squares.
%C A382180 If G is an unlabeled finite simple graph, define its square S(G) to be the graph with the same vertices as G. The edges of S(G) are the edges of G together with an edge from vertex u to v whenever u and v are not adjacent in G but are joined by a path of length 2. [There is an obvious generalization to the square of a directed graph.- _N. J. A. Sloane_, Mar 24 2025]
%C A382180 The present definition, the number of unlabeled connected graphs with n vertices which are squares, implies "which are squares of connected graphs on n vertices", since if G is not connected, neither is its square. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Mar 24 2025.
%C A382180 If the squares of two trees are isomorphic, then the trees themselves are isomorphic [Ross and Harary]. Thus the number of squares of trees is the same as the number of trees, A000055.
