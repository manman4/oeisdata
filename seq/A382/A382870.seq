%e A382870 For n = 3, the set S = {0, 1, 3} (diameter 3) covers the set of integers Z when translated by ...0, 1, 5, 6, 10, 11... with primitive period 5. Periodic coverings of Z by translates of S with smaller period are possible (e.g. by taking the entire Z as the set of translations) but they have greater density of overlaps and thus are not optimal. A different set can have a different period of an optimal covering, e.g. {0, 3} has the minimum period of 2 achieved by translations by ...0, 2, 4..., but a(n) maximizes over the subsets of diameter n, and the maximum is attained by S, so a(3) = 5.
