%N A382281 Let n encode the edges of a graph by taking edges (u,v), with u < v, in colexicographic order ((0,1), (0,2), (1,2), (0,3), ...) and adding each edge to the graph if the corresponding binary digit of n (starting with the least significant digit) is 1. a(n) is the smallest nonnegative integer that encodes the same unlabeled graph as n (disregarding any isolated vertices), i.e., the code of the graph as defined in A076184.
%F A382281 a(n) <= n with equality if and only if n is in A076184.
%e A382281 n = 6 is 110 in binary, encoding the graph with edges (0,2) and (1,2), i.e., the path graph on 3 vertices. The canonical code of that graph is a(6) = 3, corresponding to the graph with edges (0,1) and (0,2).
