%N A382868 a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2. For n > 2 a(n) is the smallest novel number divisible by the smallest prime p which divides a(n-1) but does not divide a(n-2). If no such prime exists a(n) is the least novel k such that gcd(k, a(n-1)) > 1.
%C A382868 Similar to A064413, from which it departs at a(19) = 25. Any odd prime p is preceded by a multiple of itself. Conjectured to be a permutation of the natural numbers, with primes occurring in natural order.

%H A382868 Michael De Vlieger, <a href="/A382868/a382868_1.png">Log log scatterplot of a(n)</a>, n = 1..2^16, showing primes in red, proper prime powers in gold, squarefree composites in green, and numbers neither squarefree nor prime powers in blue and purple, where purple additionally represents powerful numbers that are not prime powers. Primorials are highlighted with large green points.
%e A382868 a(3) = 4 since 2|2 but 2 !| 1. Then since there is no prime which dives 4 but not 2, a(4) = 6, the least novel k such that gcd(k, 4) > 1. Since 3|6 but 3!|4, a(5) = 3.
%e A382868 Every prime term is followed by the least novel multiple of itself.
