%N A382328 Maximum possible product of differences of every pair in a set of nonnegative integers with sum n.
%C A382328 It seems that for n>=45, if m(m+1)/2<=n<(m+1)(m+2)/2, the set to provide the maximum product has m+1 elements, such as for n=46, the maximum product is reached by set {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10}.

%e A382328 For n=7, the nonnegative integer set {0,1,2,4} has sum 7 and the product of number pairs is (1-0)*(2-0)*(4-0)*(2-1)*(4-1)*(4-2)=48 which is larger than any other sets with sum 7, so a(7)=48.
