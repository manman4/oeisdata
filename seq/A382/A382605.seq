%N A382605 Number of distinct solutions to the problem of folding in half a chain of linked rods of length 1, ..., n.
%C A382605 In order to be able to fold such chain in half, the total length of the chain (A000217(n)) has to be even, which is true when n=3 (mod 4) or n=0 (mod 4).
%C A382605 Conjecture: Whenever the length of the chain is even, there is at least one solution. That makes A154708 the sequence that lists numbers k that have at least one solution.

%e A382605 A chain of 7 rods of length 1 to 7, can be folded in half in only one way: 2+3+4+5 on one side, 6+7+1, on the other, both sides being 14 in total length. Therefore a(7) = 1.
