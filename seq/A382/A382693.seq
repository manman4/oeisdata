%N A382693 Number of dense symmetric binary relations on {1,...,n}.
%C A382693 A binary relation R is usually called dense if for all R-related x and y there exists z such that x and z and also z and y are R-related (see Wikipedia link), but here we define a symmetric binary relation R on {1,...,n} to be "dense" (see the second page of the paper in the links) iff for all x and y we have (zRx implies zRy for all z) implies (x <= y).
%C A382693 Equivalently, as mentioned in a SeqFan post (see link), for all x < y, some z satisfies (not zRx) AND zRy.
%C A382693 Note that terms were added for n = 7 and 8 in a SeqFan post (see link).
