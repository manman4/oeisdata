%N A382876 Number of ways to permute the prime indices of n so that the run-sums are all different.
%C A382876 A prime index of n is a number m such that prime(m) divides n. The multiset of prime indices of n is row n of A112798, sum A056239.
%C A382876 A run in a sequence is a constant consecutive subsequence. The run-sums of a sequence are obtained by splitting it into maximal runs and taking their sums. See A353932 for run-sums of standard compositions.
%e A382876 For n = 12, none of the permutations (1,1,2), (1,2,1), (2,1,1) has distinct run-sums, so a(12) = 0.
%e A382876 The prime indices of 36 are {1,1,2,2}, and we have permutations: (1,1,2,2), (2,2,1,1), so a(36) = 2.
%e A382876 For n = 90 we have:
%e A382876   (1,2,2,3)
%e A382876   (1,3,2,2)
%e A382876   (2,2,1,3)
%e A382876   (2,2,3,1)
%e A382876   (3,1,2,2)
%e A382876   (3,2,2,1)
%e A382876 So a(90) = 6. The 6 missing permutations are: (1,2,3,2), (2,1,2,3), (2,1,3,2), (2,3,1,2), (2,3,2,1), (3,2,1,2).
