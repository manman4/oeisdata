%N A382028 Lexicographically earliest sequence of positive integers such that a(n) is the length of the n-th run of consecutive, equal terms and no two runs have the same product.

%e A382028 a(12)..a(13) = 4: This is the 6th run. a(6) = 2, so the 6th run has length 2. We cannot use 1 as any run of 1s would have the same product as the first run a(1) = 1. Runs of length 2 made of 2s and 3s have already occurred, so a(12)..a(13) = 4.
%e A382028 a(27)..a(30) = 3: This is the 12th run. a(12) = 4, so the 12th run has length 4. We cannot use 1 for the same reason mentioned above. We cannot have 2 because a run of four 2s has product 16, which would be the same as that of the 6th run of two 4s. So a(27)..a(30) = 3, a run whose product has not occurred before in a previous run.
