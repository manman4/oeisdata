%N A382357 Lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct positive integers such that the 2-adic valuations of adjacent terms differ exactly by one.
%C A382357 The first term with a given 2-adic valuation, say k, is necessarily 2^k.
%C A382357 Empirically, powers of two appear as pairs of consecutive terms.
%C A382357 We cannot have three consecutive powers of 2: if a(n) = 2^k and a(n+1) = 2^(k+1) then a(n+2) <= 3*2^k < 2^(k+2).
%C A382357 All powers of two appear in the sequence:
%C A382357 - by contradiction: if 2^m is missing, then the 2-adic valuation of the terms of the sequence is bounded by m,
%C A382357 - by necessity, we have some k < m such that all the integers with 2-adic valuation k appear in the sequence,
%C A382357 - hence all integers with 2-adic valuation k+1 (and k-1 provided k > 0) will appear in the sequence,
%C A382357 - gradually, all integers with 2-adic valuation k+2, k+3, etc. and eventually 2^m, will appear, a contradiction.
%C A382357 Conjecture: this sequence is a permutation of the positive integers.
%C A382357 The fact that A007814 contains every positive integer infinitely many times is not sufficient to guarantee that the present sequence is a permutation of the positive integers (the variant based on A003602 instead of A007814 contains only finitely many even numbers, and so is not a permutation of the positive integers, although A003602 contains every positive integer infinitely many times).
