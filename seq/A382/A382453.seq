%N A382453 Lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct terms such that no term is a substring of the sum of any two terms.
%C A382453 The "two terms" mentioned in the name are not necessarily distinct, so no term is the substring of the double of any term.
%C A382453 The first digit of every term is less than 5.
%e A382453 For calculating a(3):
%e A382453 If 4 was in the sequence, 1+3 = 4 would have 4, itself, as a substring, so it is disallowed.
%e A382453 If 5 was in the sequence, 5+5 = 10 would have 1 as a substring, so it is disallowed.
%e A382453 The first term that is allowed is 21, since 21 is the first term not to have 1, 3, or itself as a substring of any of the following: 1+21 = 22, 3+21 = 24, 21+21 = 42.
%e A382453 So, a(3) = 21.
