%N A382259 a(n) = number of empty places to fill on an infinite square grid, at the n-th step, in order to completely surround the last square filled at the previous step n-1, starting with the origin at step 0.
%C A382259 "Surround" is meant in the sense of von-Neumann neighborhoods, as can be seen from a(1) = 8. Thereafter, all terms are strictly less than 8, and actually less than 6, except for a(1).
%C A382259 a(0) = 1 corresponds to the square at the origin filled at the beginning.
%C A382259 These are the first differences of A382258 which gives the number of squares filled after each step (with some more prescriptions for numbering).
%e A382259 a(0) = 1 because at the beginning, we fill the square at the origin.
%e A382259 a(1) = 8 because at the first step, we surround the square at the origin by filling the 8 neighboring squares (counter-clockwise, starting at the right or east, then north-east, north, etc.).
%e A382259 a(2) = 5 because in the second step, we surround the 9th and last square previously filled (to the south-east of the origin) by filling its 5 neighbors that were not filled earlier, again going counter clockwise, starting at the south-western corner.
