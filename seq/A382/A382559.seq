%N A382559 a(n) is the length of the longest subsequence at indices in arithmetic progression ending at a(n-1) whose terms form an arithmetic progression in some order; a(1)=1.
%C A382559 First differs from A362881 at a(15).
%C A382559 This is a variant of A362881 in which the terms of an arithmetic progression can occur in any order.

%e A382559 a(21) = 4: The subsequence at indices i = 2,8,14,20 (common difference 6) is {1,3,2,4} which can be rearranged to form the arithmetic progression {1,2,3,4}. We find that the longest such subsequence ending at a(20) has length 4, so a(21) = 4.
