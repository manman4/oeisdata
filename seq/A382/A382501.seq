%N A382501 Lexicographically earliest infinite sequence of positive integers such that, for any given k, every subsequence {a(j), a(j+k), a(j+2k)} (j, k >= 1) is unique.
%C A382501 Every subsequence {a(n-2k), a(n-k) a(n)} with its corresponding k value (or index spacing) is unique.

%e A382501 To find a(10) = 4, we first try 1. We cannot have a(10) = 1 because this would create the subsequence {1,1,1} at i = 6,8,10, which occurred before at i = 1,3,5. In both cases, k = 2, which is not allowed .
%e A382501 a(10) cannot be 2 because then the subsequence {1,1,2} at i = 2,6,10 would be the same as {1,1,2} at  i = 1,5,9. In both cases, k = 4.
%e A382501 a(10) cannot be 3 because {1,1,3} at i = 6,8,10 would be the same as the subsequence at i = 3,5,7. In both cases, k = 2.
%e A382501 When we try a(10) = 4, we see that none of the new subsequences formed have occurred before with the same k value. Since 4 is a first occurrence, every subsequence created is new, and although i = 6,8,10 has the same subsequence {1,1,4} as i = 2,6,10, the k value is different, which is allowed. So a(10) = 4.
