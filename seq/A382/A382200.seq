%N A382200 Numbers that can be written as a product of distinct squarefree numbers.
%C A382200 First differs from A339741 in having 1080.
%C A382200 First differs from A382075 in having 18000.
%C A382200 These are positions of positive terms in A050326, complement A293243.
%C A382200 Also numbers whose prime indices can be partitioned into distinct sets.
%C A382200 Differs from A212167, which does not include 18000 = 2^4*3^2*5^3, for example. - _R. J. Mathar_, Mar 23 2025

%e A382200 The prime indices of 1080 are {1,1,1,2,2,2,3}, and {{1},{2},{1,2},{1,2,3}} is a partition into a set of sets, so 1080 is in the sequence.
%e A382200 We have 18000 = 2*5*6*10*30, so 18000 is in the sequence.
