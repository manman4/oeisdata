%N A382260 Decimal expansion of x, where x is the smallest number for which floor(x^(phi^k)) is prime for k > 0 where phi = (1+sqrt(5))/2, assuming that Oppermann's conjecture holds.
%C A382260 This constant can generate for all exponents k > 0 a prime number if the following conjecture is true: Let p be a prime > 2 and q = nexprime(p+1) then if there is always at least one prime inside the interval nextprime(p*q) to nextprime((p+1)*q)). But if this constant can generate prime numbers for all k, it is not directly a proof of this conjecture. If we would strengthen this further by omitting "nextprime" and allowing natural numbers for p and q, we will obtain essentially Oppermann's conjecture.
