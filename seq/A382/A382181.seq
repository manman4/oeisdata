%N A382181 Number of unlabeled graphs with n vertices (including disconnected graphs) which are squares.
%C A382181 If G is an unlabeled finite simple graph, define its square S(G) to be the graph with the same vertices as G. The edges of S(G) are the edges of G together with an edge from vertex u to v whenever u and v are not adjacent in G but are joined by a path of length 2.
