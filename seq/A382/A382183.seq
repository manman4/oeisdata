%H A382183 Jeffrey Shallit, <a href="/A382183/a382183.pdf">Fibonacci automaton for a(n)</a>.
%F A382183 a(n) = A105774(n) - ceiling(A382113(n-1)/g), where g = (1+sqrt(5))/2 is the golden ratio.
%F A382183 There is a Fibonacci automaton of 12 states computing a(n). To use it, express n in Zeckendorf representation, feed it into the automaton, and the last state reached contains the value of a(n). See the file in the Links section.
