%N A176745 Zero followed by powers of 2 (A131577) and the integers that cannot be represented as a sum of two earlier terms in the sequence.
%e A176745 3 is not included in the sequence as it is a sum 2+1 of terms already included. 4 is included because it is a power of two. 5 = 4+1 and 6 = 4+2 are not included. 7 is not a sum of two of the terms 0,1,2,4 already included, so 7 is included. 11 = 7+4 is not included.
