%N A178482 Phi-antipalindromic numbers.
%C A178482 We call m a phi-antipalindromic number if for the vector (a,...,b) (a<...<b) of exponents of its base-phi expansion, we have (a,...,b)=(-b,...,-a). For n>=2, either a(n)+1 or a(n)-1 is in the sequence; also either a(n)+3 or a(n)-3 is in the sequence.
%C A178482 Conjecture: this is the sequence of numbers k for which f(k) is an integer, where f(x) is the change-of-base function defined at A214969 using b=phi and c=b^2. - _Clark Kimberling_, Oct 17 2012
%C A178482 There is a 21-state automaton accepting the Zeckendorf representations of those n in this sequence. - _Jeffrey Shallit_, May 03 2023
%C A178482 Kimberling's conjecture has been proven by Ingrid Vukusic and myself. Along the way we prove an alternate characterization of the sequence:  they are the positive integers whose base-phi expansion consists only of even exponents of phi. - _Jeffrey Shallit_, Aug 28 2025
%C A178482 Alternatively, this sequence consists of those numbers k such that either k or k-1 can be written as the (possibly empty) sum of distinct Lucas numbers L_i where i>=2 and i is even. - _Jeffrey Shallit_, Aug 28 2025

%F A178482 For k>=1, a(2^k) = A005248(k); if 2^k<n<2^(k+1), then a(n) = a(2^k)+a(n-2^k).
%e A178482 The vectors of exponents of 4 and 5 are (-2,0,2) and (-4,-1,3) correspondingly (cf.A104605). Therefore by definition 4 is a phi-antipalindromic number, while 5 is not. Let n=38. Then k=5. Thus a(38)=A005248(5)+a(6)=123+10=133. The vector of exponents of phi in the base-phi expansion of 133 is (-10,-4,-2,2,4,10).
