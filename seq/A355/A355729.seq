%N A355729 Tournament standing, under standard rules double elimination, of the participant whose elimination leaves n participants still in the tournament.
%C A355729 Standard rules of Double Elimination tournaments lead to equal standings for many players; the farther from the top, the less the placement distinguishes the skill between opponents.
%C A355729 If you were outside a building in which a double elimination tournament was taking place, with N players participating, and each of them walked out of the building the moment they were eliminated, then, using the sequence, you could tell exactly what standing the player exiting the building obtained: If they exit the building k-th then their standing is a(n), where n = N - k.
%C A355729 The last four players to get eliminated in the tournament have the standings of 1, 2, 3, and 4, then there are two 5's that stand for the 5th and the 6th best players, because of that the next number is 7, so there are two 7's, then four 9's and 13's, eight 17's and 25's, sixteen 33's and 49's, and so on.
%F A355729 True definition: A directed tree graph built according to Double Elimination tournament rules is drawn. If any node has the value of n, one of its child nodes copies it, and then their child and so on until there are no more child nodes. The starting node has the value of 1, its child that doesn't have the value of 1 assumes the value of 2. Nodes with values 3 and 4 have obvious placements, but from there there are 2 equally close to the 1 node candidates for 5 and 6. Both of them take the value of 5, and the next unsigned node must take the value of 7. Every other dispute is solved this same way. In the end take the finish nodes, order them in an ascending order according to their value, that's the sequence.
%F A355729 floor(2.5) = 2.
%F A355729 There are two sequences that form this sequence:
%F A355729   a1(n) = 2^floor(log_2(n)) + 1;
%F A355729 {a1(n)} = {1,  2,   3,3,  5,5,5,5,  9, 9, 9, 9, 9, ...};
%F A355729   a2(n) = (3/2)*2^floor(log_2(n)) + 1.
%F A355729 {a2(n)} = {1, 2.5,  4,4,  7,7,7,7, 13,13,13,13,13, ...};
%F A355729 While the target sequence is
%F A355729 {a(n)} =  {1,  2,   3,4,  5,5,7,7,  9,9,9,9,13, ...}.
%F A355729 We can use a comparison sequence
%F A355729   a3(n) = a1(n - 2^floor(log_2(n)-1));
%F A355729 {a3(n)} = {1, 1.5,  2,3,  3,3,5,5,  5,5,5,5}.
%F A355729 If a3(n) != a1(n) then a(n) = a1(n), otherwise a(n) = a2(n).
%F A355729 a(n) = {1 if n=0;
%F A355729   a1(n) if a3(n) != a1(n);
%F A355729   a2(n) if a3(n) == a1(n)}.
%F A355729 a(0) = 1, a(n) = n - ((2*n) mod 2^floor(log_2(n)))/2 + 1 for n > 0. - _Jon E. Schoenfield_, Jul 20 2022
%e A355729 For n = 18:
%e A355729 a1(18) = 2^floor(log_2(18)) + 1 = 2^4 + 1 = 17;
%e A355729 a2(18) = (3/2)*2^floor(log_2(18)) + 1 = (3/2)*16 + 1 = 25;
%e A355729 a3(18) = a1(18 - 2^floor(log_2(18)-1)) = a1(18 - 2^3) = a1(10) = 2^3 + 1 = 9;
%e A355729 a3(18) != a1(18), thus a(18) = a1(18) = 17.
