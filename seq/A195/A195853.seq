%N A195853 Decimal expansion of the lower limit of A139250(i)/i^2.
%C A195853 Constant mentioned in the Applegate-Pol-Sloane article, Section 5, the fractal-like structure. It is also mentioned in A139250 and A170927.
%C A195853 Note that at least there are 162 constants starting with 0.451305 in the Plouffe's Inverter.
%C A195853 Also evidently half the lower limit of A147562(n)/n^2; see A260239. - _Steven Finch_, Jul 21 2015
