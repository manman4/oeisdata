%N A262312 The limit, as word-length approaches infinity, of the probability that a random binary word is an instance of the Zimin pattern "aba"; also the probability that a random infinite binary word begins with an even-length palindrome.
%C A262312 Word W over alphabet L is an instance of "aba" provided there exists a nonerasing monoid homomorphism f:{a,b}*->L* such that f(W)=aba. For example "oompaloompa" is an instance of "aba" via the homomorphism defined by f(a)=oompa, f(b)=l. For a proof of the formula or more information on Zimin words, see Rorabaugh (2015).
%C A262312 The second definition comes from a Comment in A094536: "The probability that a random, infinite binary string begins with an even-length palindrome is: lim n -> infinity a(n)/2^n ~ 0.7322131597821108... . - _Peter Kagey_, Jan 26 2015"
%C A262312 Also, the limit, as word-length approaches infinity, of the probability that a random binary word has a bifix; that is, 1-x where x is the constant from A242430. - _Danny Rorabaugh_, Feb 13 2016

%F A262312 The constant is Sum_{n>=0} A003000(n)*(1/4)^n.
%F A262312 Using the recursive definition of A003000, one can derive the series Sum_{j>=0} 2*(-1)^j*(1/4)^(2^j)/(Product_{k=0..j} 1-2*(1/4)^(2^k)), which converges more quickly to the same limit and without having to calculate terms of A003000.
%F A262312 For ternary words, the constant is Sum_{n>=0} A019308(n)*(1/9)^n.
%F A262312 For quaternary words, the constant is Sum_{n>=0} A019309(n)*(1/16)^n.
