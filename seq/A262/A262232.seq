%N A262232 Number of black and white n-bead necklaces with at least 3 white beads (turning over is not allowed); also number of clockwise arrangements of reflex and non-reflex angles that can form an n-gon.
%C A262232 A reflex angle is an angle with measure greater than Pi or 180 degrees. Every polygon has at least three angles with measure less than Pi or 180 degrees.

%F A262232 a(n) = A000031(n) - 2 - floor(n/2), n>0.
%e A262232 Let 1's represent black beads and 0's represent white beads. For n=6, the a(6)=9 necklaces are 000000, 000001, 000011, 000101, 000111, 001001, 001011, 001101, 010101. Note that 001011 and 001101 would be equivalent if "turning over" were allowed.
