%N A389518 a(n) is the number of 4 element sets of integer sided trapezoids with distinct areas and base angles that are 60 degrees, which fill an equilateral triangular grid of side n units.
%C A389518 A trapezoid whose base angles are 60 degrees with longer base b and legs s is denoted by {b X s} in the examples and has area s*(2b - s) times that of a unit equilateral triangle.
%C A389518 This is the sequence generated by removing sets containing trapezoids of equal areas from the sequence A389392.
%F A389518 a(n) <= A389392(n).
%e A389518 When n = 8, A389392 has 40 sets of distinct trapezoids and the following 4 sets which contains trapezoids with equal area are removed to obtain 36 sets:
%e A389518    {{2 X 1}, {7 X 1}, {7 X 2}, {5 X 4}},
%e A389518    {{3 X 1}, {6 X 1}, {7 X 2}, {5 X 4}},
%e A389518    {{4 X 1}, {5 X 1}, {7 X 2}, {5 X 4}},
%e A389518    {{4 X 1}, {8 X 1}, {4 X 3}, {5 X 3}}.
%Y A389518 Cf. A389392.
