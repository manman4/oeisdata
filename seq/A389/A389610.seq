%N A389610 Same as A389609, except only consider prime divisors, instead of all divisors.
%C A389610 Let D(k) = list of the distinct prime divisors of k in increasing order, and let C = [D(a(1)), D(a(2)), D(a(3)), ...]. The sequence is the lexicographically earliest sequence of integers > 1 which is equal to the partial sums of C.
%C A389610 We start with 2, since 1 has no prime divisors. If a(1)=2, a(2)=3 does not work. If a(1)=2 and a(2)=4, a(3)=5 does not work, but a(1)=2, a(2)=4, a(3)=6  gives C = [2, 2, 2, 3,...] with partial sums [2, 4, 6, 9, ...], and we can take a(4) = 9, and from this point on the sequence is uniquely determined by its existing terms.
%C A389610 Inspired by A389395, which is a similar sequence based on proper divisors.
