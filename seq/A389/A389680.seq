%N A389680 Numbers k for which no i > 1 exists such that k + i is composite and its least prime factor exceeds i^2.
%C A389680 The density of this sequence decreases with n.
%C A389680 It is conjectured that this sequence is finite (see Erdős Problems link).
%C A389680 Search for i can stop once i^4 < k+i. This is because for the least prime factor lpf(k+i) we have: lpf(k+i)>i^2 and lpf(k+i) <= sqrt(k+i). So, i^2 < sqrt(k+i) and i^4 < k+i.

%e A389680 Number 23 is not in the sequence because there exist i > 1, i = 2 such that the least prime factor of 23 + 2 which is 5 is greater than i^2 = 4.
