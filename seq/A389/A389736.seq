%N A389736 Standard composition numbers of integer compositions whose 0-prepended first differences are not all equal.
%C A389736 The k-th composition in standard order (graded reverse-lexicographic, A066099) is obtained by taking the set of positions of 1's in the reversed binary expansion of k, prepending 0, taking first differences, and reversing again. This gives a bijective correspondence between nonnegative integers and integer compositions.

%Y A389736 Subsets not of this type are counted by A054519.
%Y A389736 For partitions instead of compositions we have complement of A325327.
%Y A389736 For distinct non 0-prepended differences we have A389598, complement A389597.
%Y A389736 The complement is A389732, counted by A007862.
%Y A389736 The non 0-prepended version is A389735, counted by A389741.
%Y A389736 For distinct instead of equal differences we have A389738, complement A389734.
%Y A389736 These compositions are counted by A389742.
%Y A389736 A000120 gives length of standard compositions.
%Y A389736 A011782 counts compositions.
%Y A389736 A066099 lists compositions in standard order.
%Y A389736 A070939 gives sum of standard compositions.
%Y A389736 A124767 counts maximal runs in standard compositions, anti-runs A333381.
