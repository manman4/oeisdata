%N A389807 a(n) = A389805(2*n).
%C A389807 The number of partitions of T(n) = {-2*n+1, -2*n+3, ..., -3, -1, 1, 3, ..., 2*n-3, 2*n-1} into a set of irreducible balanced subsets. The overall mean value of T(n) is 0. A proper subset of T(n) is called balanced if its mean value is also 0. A balanced subset is referred to as a reducible balanced subset if it contains a smaller balanced subset, otherwise, it is called an irreducible balanced subset.
%C A389807 Partitions of T(n) into a set of irreducible balanced subsets are called complete.
