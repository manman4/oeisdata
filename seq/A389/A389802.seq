%N A389802 The number of irreducible balanced subsets of [n].
%C A389802 A proper subset of [n]={1..n} is called balanced if its mean value is also (n+1)/2, the overall mean value of [n]. A balanced subset is referred to as a reducible balanced subset if it contains a smaller balanced subset, otherwise, it is called an irreducible balanced subset (IBS).
%H A389802 Chinese BBS, <a href="https://bbs.emath.ac.cn/thread-2320-1-1.html">Balanced samples of the initial segment of natural numbers</a> (in Chinese).
%e A389802 For n=6, a(6)=3, since [6] has 3 IBSs: {1,6}, {2,5}, {3,4}.
%e A389802 For n=7, a(7)=6, since [7] has 6 IBSs: {4}, {1,7}, {2,6}, {3,5}, {1,5,6}, {2,3,7}.
%Y A389802 Cf. A389803 (odd bisection), A389804 (even bisection).
%Y A389802 Cf. A389805.
