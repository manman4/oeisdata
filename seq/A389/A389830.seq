%N A389830 Number of normal subgroups of the modular group of index n.
%C A389830 All normal subgroups of index greater than 3 have index divisible by 6.
%C A389830 The values of a(n) can be arbitrarily large by a result of Knopp and Newman (1965).
%C A389830 The modular group has infinitely many normal subgroups of infinite index.

%F A389830 a(n) = 0 for n > 3 and n !== 0 (mod 6).
%F A389830 a(6*p) = 1 + (p | 3) for p > 3 prime, where (a | b) is the Legendre symbol. (Newman, 1967)
%F A389830 a(6*p^2) = 3 + (p | 3) for p > 5 prime. (Greenberg and Newman, 1970)
%F A389830 a(12*p) = a(12*p^2) = 0 for p > 11 prime. (Newman, 1967; Greenberg and Newman, 1970)
%F A389830 a(12*p^3) = 1 for p > 11 prime. (Greenberg and Newman, 1970)
%F A389830 a(6*p^(2*r)) >= 2*r - 1 for p == 1 (mod 3) prime. (Knopp and Newman, 1965)
%F A389830 If r is a positive integer and p == 2 (mod 3) is a prime greater than r, then a(p*r) = 0. (Greenberg and Newman, 1970)
%e A389830 If Gamma denotes the modular group, and Gamma^n denotes the subgroup consisting of all n-th powers of elements of Gamma, then the normal subgroups of indices 1, 2, and 3 are Gamma, Gamma^2, and Gamma^3. The two normal subgroups of index 6 are Gamma(2) and the commutator subgroup, where Gamma(n) denotes the principal congruence subgroup of level n. The normal subgroup of index 12 is Gamma(3).
