%N A389393 Least k such that k + A005117(i) is squarefree with i prime factors, for 1 <= i <= n.
%C A389393 The set of squarefree numbers {A005117} is the lexicographically earliest set of summands {r_i} such that it is possible to get arbitrarily long stretches of squarefree numbers m + r_i.
%C A389393 The probability that k + A005117(i) is squarefree is related to the number of non-unitary prime divisors of k (A056170): the greater the number of such divisors and the smaller the magnitude of the prime, the greater the probability that k + A005117(i) is squarefree when chosen at random from the set of natural numbers (see the Englezou link). For example, within the set {1 + A005117(i)} approximately 53% of numbers are squarefree. Within the set {97560 + A005117(i)} approximately 91% are squarefree.

%F A389393 a(n) + 1 is prime by definition.
%e A389393 The set of summands {A005117} = 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, ...
%e A389393 a(1) = 1 since 2 is the first prime.
%e A389393 a(2) = 4 since 5 is prime and 6 is semiprime, and this is the earliest set of two such numbers.
%e A389393 a(3) = 192 since 193 is prime, 194 is semiprime, and 195 is sphenic, and this is the earliest set of three such numbers.
%e A389393 a(4) = 38280 since 38281 is prime, 38282 is semiprime, 38283 is sphenic, and 38285 is squarefree with four prime factors, and this is the earliest set of four such numbers.
