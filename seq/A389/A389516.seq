%N A389516 Standard composition numbers of compositions whose maximal runs R all satisfy length(R) < first(R).
%C A389516 The k-th composition in standard order (graded reverse-lexicographic, A066099) is obtained by taking the set of positions of 1's in the reversed binary expansion of k, prepending 0, taking first differences, and reversing again. This gives a bijective correspondence between nonnegative integers and integer compositions.
%e A389516 The 38036th composition in standard order is (3,2,3,3,2,3), with maximal runs ((3),(2),(3,3),(2),(3)), all satisfying length(R) < first(R), so 38036 is in the sequence.
