%N A389803 a(n) = A389802(2n+1).
%C A389803 The number of irreducible balanced subsets of T(n) = {-n, ..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ..., n}. The overall mean value of T(n) is 0. A proper subset of T(n) is called a balanced if its mean value is also 0. A balanced subset is referred to as a reducible balanced subset if it contains a smaller balanced subset, otherwise, it is called an irreducible balanced subset (IBS).
%C A389803 The IBSs of T(n) include the following 4 categories: (a) Those inherited from T(n-1); (b) {-n, n}; (c) those containing -n but not n; (d) those containing n but not -n. Among these, the latter 3 categories are exactly the newly added IBSs of T(n) compared with T(n-1). Categories (c) and (d) are negatively symmetric, so it is sufficient to calculate the count of one of them, let this count be denoted as b(n). Then, a(n) = a(n-1) + 1 + 2*b(n).

%e A389803 For n=3, a(3) = 6, since {-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3} has 6 IBSs: {0}, {-1, 1}, {-2, 2}, {-3, 3}, {-1, -2, 3}, {1, 2, -3}.
