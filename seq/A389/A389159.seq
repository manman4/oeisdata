%N A389159 Maximal number of complex spherical realizations among all minimally rigid graphs on n vertices.
%C A389159 Minimally rigid graphs in the plane (A227117) are also minimally rigid on the sphere.
%C A389159 By c_S(G) we denote the number of (complex) spherical realizations of a minimally rigid graph G, modulo rotations, when the edge lengths of the graph are chosen generically.
%C A389159 In general, this number is larger than the number of real realizations and larger than or equal to the number of realizations in the complex plane (cf. A306420).
%C A389159 Equivalently, c_S(G) is the number of complex solutions of the quadratic polynomial system {x_1 = y_1 = x_2 = 0, y_2 = l(1,2), (x_i - x_j)^2 + (y_i - y_j)^2 + (z_i - z_j)^2 = l(i,j)^2, x_k^2 + y_k^2 + z_k^2 = 1}, for all edges {i,j} and vertices k. We assume w.l.o.g. that there is an edge between the vertices 1 and 2. The quantities l(i,j) describe the (generic) edge "lengths" (they can also be complex numbers).
%C A389159 Note that the number of realizations is often counted modulo reflection additionally. In this case the realization number is half of what is listed here for n>=3.
%C A389159 Graphs that can be constructed only by a sequence of 0-extensions has 2^(n-2). A 0-extension (also called Henneberg moves of type 2) adds a new vertex and connects it with two existing vertices.
%C A389159 A graph achieving the maximal number of spherical realizations on n vertices is not necessarily unique.
