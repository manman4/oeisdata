%N A389609 Lexicographically earliest infinite sequence of distinct positive integers with the property that the partial sums of the concatenation of the divisors of the terms is the sequence itself.
%C A389609 Let D(k) = list of the divisors of k in increasing order, and let C = [D(a(1)), D(a(2)), D(a(3)), ...]. The sequence is the lexicographically earliest sequence of positive integers which is equal to the partial sums of C.
%C A389609 Inspired by A389395, which is a similar sequence based on proper divisors.

%e A389609 After a(1)=1, a(2)=2, we have C = [1, 1, 2, ...] with partial sums [1, 2, 4, ...], which suggests taking a(3) = 4, which would give C = [1,1,2,1,2,4,...] with partial sums [1,2,4,5,7,11, ...], which would suggest taking a(4), a(5), a(6) = 5,7,11. From this point on the sequence extends itself uniquely. This is the earliest possible extension, and so IS the sequence.
