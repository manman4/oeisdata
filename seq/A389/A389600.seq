%N A389600 Run-compression sum (A373953) minus number of maximal runs in the n-th composition in standard order.
%C A389600 We define the run-compression of a sequence to be the anti-run obtained by reducing each run of repeated parts to a single part. Alternatively, we remove all parts equal to the part immediately to their left. For example, (1,1,2,2,1) has run-compression (1,2,1).
%C A389600 The k-th composition in standard order (graded reverse-lexicographic, A066099) is obtained by taking the set of positions of 1's in the reversed binary expansion of k, prepending 0, taking first differences, and reversing again. This gives a bijective correspondence between nonnegative integers and integer compositions.

%e A389600 The 11th composition in standard order is (2,1,1), with run-compression (2,1) and maximal runs ((2),(1,1)), so a(11) = 3 - 2 = 1.
