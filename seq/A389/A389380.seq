%N A389380 Decimal expansion of Product_{n>=1} sqrt(2*Pi*n)*(n/e)^n*e^(1/(12*n)) / n!, the cumulative error ratio of the first-order refinement of Stirling's approximation over the positive integers.
%C A389380 The Laurent series for the error of Stirling's approximation of log(n!) (A046968/A046969) is given by the Euler-Maclaurin formula.
%C A389380 Refining Stirling's approximation, by including the first terms in these expansions, makes its logs' errors shrink like 1/n^3, so the sum of log-errors (i.e. log of product of errors) becomes convergent.
%C A389380 log-Gamma's Euler-Maclaurin series comes from applying Watson's lemma to Binet's first log-Gamma formula as a Laplace transform, so it is a rare case in which the converse of Watson's lemma holds; the closed form for the exact value can be found by summing the Laplace transforms and treating the resulting integral as the limit of a Mellin transform.
%C A389380 This is an approximation about n = 0; constants from that about n = -1/2, n = -1 are A389381, A389382. (The formula for Laurent expansions of log(n!) about n = -c was found in p.206 of the Hermite reference.)
%C A389380 The former has < 1/3rd the error, the latter has < 1/5th.
%C A389380 About 0 and -1, the first-order refinement turns a lower bound into an upper one, while about -1/2 it turns an upper into a lower one. These are special cases; the inequality's direction is not always flipped, and about some values the refinement is not an inequality at all (the error's sign is dependent on n).
