%N A389839 Smallest even number which cannot be written as the difference of two consecutive numbers which are relatively prime to the primorial prime(n)#.
%C A389839 By symmetry (since x is relatively prime to prime(n)# if and only if prime(n)# - x is), periodicity modulo prime(n)#, and the fact that prime(n)#/2 - 2 is relatively prime to prime(n)#, it is sufficient to check only the numbers relatively prime to prime(n)# that are bounded by prime(n)#/2 + 2, when starting from -1 (to also account for the difference between k*prime(n)# - 1 and k*prime(n)# + 1).

%e A389839 For n=3, a(3)=8 since since the numbers relatively prime to and bounded by prime(3)# = 30 are in the set {1, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29}. The consecutive differences are 6,4,2,4,2,4,6,2 (which then repeat). Hence 2 (also appears as 31-29), 4 and 6 do appear, but 8 does not, so a(3)=8.
%e A389839 For n=6, the differences that do appear are {2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 22}. Hence 20 is the smallest even difference not appearing.
