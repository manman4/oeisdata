%N A389401 Composite numbers that divide at least one term in every Fibonacci sequence.
%C A389401 Here a Fibonacci sequence is a sequence which begins with any two integers and continues using the rule s(n+2) = s(n+1) + s(n). These composite numbers divide at least one number in each such sequence. See similar comment in A000057.
%C A389401 For a number to be in this sequence, all its prime factors must be in A000057.
%C A389401 This sequence can apparently be generated from A000057 (the primes of A064414):
%C A389401 With the exception of 6, which is in the sequence but doesn't follow the following rules, for each term x taken from A000057:
%C A389401 - if 2*x == 14 or == 86 mod 120, all numbers of the form 2*x^k are part of the sequence, for k>0
%C A389401 - with the exceptions of 8 and its multiples, all x^k are part of the sequence for all k>1
%C A389401 Example: for x=2: 4 = x^2 is in the sequence, but because 4 is not congruent to 14 or 86 mod 120, 8 is not in the sequence.

%e A389401 23 is prime as is part of A000057.
%e A389401 529 = 23^2 is composite and is part of this sequence.
%Y A389401 Subsequence of A064414.
