%N A389141 Least positive integer k such that A389140(k*n) has the smallest value.
%C A389141 If n is not a multiple of 5, is there always some multiplier k that makes A389140(k*n) collapse to 1?
%C A389141 From _Pontus von Brömssen_, Sep 27 2025: (Start)
%C A389141 The minimum of A389140(k*n) is at least 15 if n is a multiple of 25 and at least 5 if n is a multiple of 5. It seems that the best of these bounds is attained for all such n, and that the minimum is 1 if n is not a multiple of 5.
%C A389141 It seems that a(4000) = 3 is the last term not equal to 1, 2, or 4. Moreover, it seems that
%C A389141  - a(n) = 1 if n > 8060, and either n == 25, 50 (mod 100) or n is even and not congruent to 10 modulo 20;
%C A389141  - a(n) = 2 if n > 4030, and either n is odd and not congruent to 5 (mod 10) or n == 10, 30, 70, 75, 90 (mod 100);
%C A389141  - a(n) = 4 if n > 2015, n == 5 (mod 10), and n is not a multiple of 25.
