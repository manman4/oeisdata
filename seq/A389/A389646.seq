%N A389646 Maximum number of edges that need to be removed from a triangle-free graph on n vertices to make it bipartite.
%C A389646 Erdős posed the problem of calculating this sequence and conjectured that n^2/25 edges would always be sufficient. This would be sharp as the balanced blow-up of C_5 with class sizes n/5 needs at least n^2/25 edges removed to be made bipartite.
%C A389646 Every triangle-free graph on n vertices G, which is not bipartite, has a vertex x of degree d(x) <= 2n/5 (Andrásfai, Erdős, Sós). G\x can be made bipartite by removing a(n-1) edges. And x can be added to this coloring by removing at most d(x)/2 edges incident on x. Therefore a(n) <= a(n-1) + n/5. (Proof by Martin Fuller: see the SeqFan link.)
%C A389646 The value a(23)=20 is achieved by a 5-cycle with vertices blown up into independent sets of size 4,5,4,5,5 in cyclic order, plus 5 of its subgraphs. - _Brendan McKay_, 17 Oct 2025
