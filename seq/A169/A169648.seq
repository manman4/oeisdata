%N A169648 Number of cells that are turned from OFF to ON at stage n in Wolfram's 2-D cellular automaton defined by Rule 942.
%C A169648 We work on the square grid. A cell is turned ON iff exactly one or four of its four neighbors is ON. Once a cell is ON it stays ON. At stage -1 all cells are OFF. At stage 0 a single cell is turned ON.
%C A169648 This sequence also arises from Rule 467 (New Kind of Science, page 173) if we count white cells, black cells in alternate generations. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Feb 04 2015

%F A169648 Added Apr 15 2010: The sequence is the sum of A147582(n) and 4 times A169689(4n), both of which have simple explicit formulas for the n-th term. See those two entries for details.
%F A169648 The sequence is generated by the following recurrence (this is true, but unnecessarily complicated): Take a(0),...,a(7) as initial values.
%F A169648 For n >= 8, write n = 2^k + j with 0 <= j < 2^k. Then:
%F A169648 a(2^k)=3a(2^(k-1))+3*2^(k-1)-8 (this is for j=0),
%F A169648 a(3*2^(k-1))=3a(3*2^(k-2))+2^(k+1)-24 (this is for j=2^(k-1)),
%F A169648 and otherwise
%F A169648 a(2^k+j)=a(2^(k-1)+j) for 0 < j < 2^(k-1)-1,
%F A169648 a(2^k+j)=3a(2^(k-1)+j) for 2^(k-1) < j < 2^k.
%F A169648 The leading terms in the rows are essentially 4*A169651, and the "midpoints" of the rows are essentially 4*A169650.
%F A169648 See A169688, A169689 for a simpler (but equivalent) recurrence for this sequence.
