%N A248868 Exponents n that make k! < k^n < (k+1)! hold true for some integer k > 1, in increasing order by k, then n (if applicable).
%C A248868 This sequence consists of those positive integers that, when taken as exponents of some positive integer greater than 1, make the corresponding power of that other integer fall strictly between its factorial and the factorial of the next integer, as shown in the examples.
%C A248868 The sequence { floor(log_n((n+1)!)) | n>=2 } is a subsequence.
%C A248868 This sequence is nondecreasing. Indeed for k>1, k^n<(k+1)! implies n<=k, which implies ((k+1)/k)^(n-1) <= (1 + 1/k)^(k-1) = Sum_{i=0..k-1} binomial(k-1,i) (1/k)^i < Sum_{i=0..k-1} ((k-1)/k)^i < k, which implies (k+1)^(n-1)<k^n<(k+1)!. - _Danny Rorabaugh_, Apr 03 2015
%C A248868 From _Danny Rorabaugh_, Apr 15 2015: (Start)
%C A248868 This sequence is the same as A074184 for 6<=n<=10000.
%C A248868 For k > 2, k! < k^(ceiling(log_k(k!))) < (k+1)!.
%C A248868 The two sequences continue to be identical provided k^(1 + ceiling(log_k(k!))) > (k+1)! when k > 5.
%C A248868 This is equivalent to k^(2 - fractional_part(log_k(k!))) > k + 1, which can be approximated by fractional_part(1/2 - (k + sqrt(2*Pi))/log(k)) < 1 - 1/(k*log(k)) using Stirling's approximation.
%C A248868 Are either of the final inequalities true for all sufficiently large k?
