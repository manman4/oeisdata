%N A119770 Number of different antimatroids on n labeled items.
%C A119770 See link for software to generate the sequence. a(8) should be roughly 2^78 and seems hopeless without more mathematics.
%C A119770 Antimatroids are a subset of greedoids, usually defined either in terms of set systems, as David Eppstein does in his tree searches, or in terms of formal languages. The two are equivalent, as discussed in Kempner and Levit. - _Jonathan Vos Post_, Jun 20 2006
