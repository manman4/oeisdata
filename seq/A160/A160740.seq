%N A160740 Toothpick sequence starting from a cross formed by 4 toothpicks.
%C A160740 On the infinite square grid we start at stage 0 with no toothpicks. Toothpicks have length 2. At stage 1 we place two consecutive toothpicks in the vertical direction and two consecutive toothpicks in the horizontal direction forming a cross centered at the origin. At stage 2 we place four toothpicks. At stage 3 we place eight toothpicks. For more information about the toothpick sequences see A139250. - _Omar E. Pol_, Nov 24 2011
