%N A160952 a(n)=largest (n+1)-digit prime formed by appending a digit to a(n-1); a(0)=2.
%C A160952 There is no prime a(8) since 293999991 to 293999999 are all composite.
%C A160952 This is also one of five longest possible sequences of primes where each term is formed by appending a digit to the previous term. Alternatively, one can view 29399999 as a prime where truncating the last digit successively always produces a prime. These are called Right-truncatable primes and the other four with 8 digits are 23399339, 37337999, 5939339 and 73939133. A list of all 83 possible Right-truncatable primes can be found in links for A024770. I have independently verified that this list is complete.
%e A160952 a(0)=2, a(1)=29, a(2)=293, a(3)=2939, a(4)=29399, a(5)=293999, a(6)=2939999, a(7)=29399999.
