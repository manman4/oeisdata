%N A160426 Toothpick sequence starting from an asymmetric cross, with four edges of length 1, 2, 3 and 4, formed by five toothpicks of length 2.
%C A160426 On the infinite square grid we start at stage 0 with no toothpicks. At stage 1 we place three consecutive toothpicks and two orthogonal toothpicks, as an asymetric cross with four edges of length 1, 2, 3, and 4, then a(1)=5. At stage 2 we place 4 toothpicks. And so on...
%C A160426 The sequence gives the number of toothpicks in the structure after n stages. A160427 (the first differences) gives the number added at the n-th stage. See A139250 for more information about toothpick sequences.
