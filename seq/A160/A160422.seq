%N A160422 Number of "ON" cells at n-th stage in simple 2-dimensional cellular automaton whose virtual skeleton is a polyedge as the toothpick structure of A139250 but with toothpicks of length 6.
%C A160422 a(n) is also the number of grid points that are covered after n-th stage by an polyedge as the toothpick structure of A139250, but with toothpicks of length 6.

%F A160422 a(n) = A147614(n)+4*A139250(n) = A160420(n)+2*A139250(n) since each toothpick covers exactly four more grid points than the corresponding toothpick in A147614.
