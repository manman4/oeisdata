%N A160808 Toothpick sequence in Fibonacci spiral (see Comments lines for definition).
%C A160808 On the infinite square grid we draw a Fibonacci spiral starting with 4,4,8,12,20,32,... (Note that each edge has length = A000045(k)*4, for k>0). We start at stage 0 with no toothpicks. At stage 1 we place a toothpick of length 2 in a orthogonal direction, in the center of the Fibonacci spiral. At stage 2 we place 2 toothpicks. And so on... The sequence gives the number of toothpicks in the Fibonacci spiral after n stages. A160809 (the first differences) gives the number added at the n-th stage. See 160800, A160802 and A139250 for more information about toothpick sequences.
