%N A160172 T-toothpick sequence (see Comments lines for definition).
%C A160172 A T-toothpick is formed from three toothpicks of equal length, in the shape of a T. There are three endpoints. We call the middle of the top toothpick the pivot point.
%C A160172 We start at round 0 with no T-toothpicks.
%C A160172 At round 1 we place a T-toothpick anywhere in the plane.
%C A160172 At round 2 we place three other T-toothpicks.
%C A160172 And so on...
%C A160172 The rule for adding a new T-toothpick is the following. A new T-toothpick is added at any exposed endpoint, with the pivot point touching the endpoint and so that the crossbar of the new toothpick is perpendicular to the exposed end.
%C A160172 The sequence gives the number of T-toothpicks after n rounds. A160173 (the first differences) gives the number added at the n-th round.
%C A160172 See the entry A139250 for more information about the toothpick process and the toothpick propagation.
%C A160172 On the infinite square grid a T-toothpick can be represented as a square polyedge with three components from a central point: two consecutive components on the same straight-line and a centered orthogonal component.
%C A160172 If the T-toothpick has three components then at the n-th round the structure is a polyedge with 3*a(n) components.
%C A160172 From _Omar E. Pol_, Mar 26 2011: (Start)
%C A160172 For formula and more information see the Applegate-Pol-Sloane paper, chapter 11, "T-shaped toothpicks". See also A160173.
%C A160172 Also, this sequence can be illustrated using another structure in which every T-toothpick is replaced by an isosceles right triangle. (End)
%C A160172 The structure is very distinct but the graph is similar to the graphs from the following sequences: A147562, A160164, A162795, A169707, A187220, A255366, A256260, at least for the known terms from Data section. - _Omar E. Pol_, Nov 24 2015
%C A160172 Shares with A255366 some terms with the same index, for example the element a(43) = 1729, the Hardy-Ramanujan number. - _Omar E. Pol_, Nov 25 2015
