%N A160118 Number of "ON" cells at n-th stage in simple 2-dimensional cellular automaton (see Comments for precise definition).
%C A160118 On the infinite square grid, we start at stage 0 with all square cells in the OFF state.
%C A160118 Define a "peninsula cell" to a cell that is connected to the structure by exactly one of its vertices.
%C A160118 At stage 1 we turn ON a single cell in the central position.
%C A160118 For n>1, if n is even, at stage n we turn ON all the OFF neighboring cells from cells that were turned in ON at stage n-1.
%C A160118 For n>1, if n is odd, at stage n we turn ON all the peninsular OFF cells.
%C A160118 For the corresponding corner sequence, see A160796.
%C A160118 An animation will show the fractal-like behavior (cf. A139250).
%C A160118 For the first differences see A160415. - _Omar E. Pol_, Mar 21 2011
%C A160118 First differs from A188343 at a(13). - _Omar E. Pol_, Mar 28 2011

%e A160118 In the first generation, only the central "1" is ON, a(1)=1. In the next generation, we turn ON eight "2" around the central cell, leading to a(2)=a(1)+8=9. In the third generation, four "3" are turned ON at the vertices of the square, a(3)=a(2)+4=13. And so on...
