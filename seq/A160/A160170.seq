%N A160170 X-toothpick sequence on Z^3 lattice (see Comments for precise definition).
%C A160170 Here a "X-toothpick" is defined to be a cross with 4 endpoints and a midpoint. Also, a X-toothpick can be represented by set of four connected toothpicks forming a cross.
%C A160170 We start at stage 0 on the Z^3 lattice with no X-toothpicks.
%C A160170 At stage 1 place a X-toothpick.
%C A160170 Rule: each exposed endpoint of the X-toothpicks of the old generation must be touched by the midpoint of a X-toothpick of new generation (see illustrations).
%C A160170 The sequence gives the number of X-toothpicks in the three-dimensional structure after n-th stage. A170171 (the first differences) gives the number of X-toothpicks added at n-th stage.
%C A160170 For a similar sequence but starting with a single toothpick see A170876.
%C A160170 For the X-toothpick sequence on Z^2 lattice see A147562, the Ulam-Warburton cellular automaton.
%C A160170 For more information about the growth of toothpicks see A139250.
