%N A160120 Y-toothpick sequence (see Comments lines for definition).
%C A160120 A Y-toothpick (or Y-shaped toothpick) is formed from three toothpicks of length 1, like a star with three endpoints and only one middle-point.
%C A160120 On the infinite triangular grid, we start at round 0 with no Y-toothpicks.
%C A160120 At round 1 we place a Y-toothpick anywhere in the plane.
%C A160120 At round 2 we add three more Y-toothpicks. After round 2, in the structure there are three rhombuses and a hexagon.
%C A160120 At round 3 we add three more Y-toothpicks.
%C A160120 And so on ... (see illustrations).
%C A160120 The sequence gives the number of Y-toothpicks after n rounds. A160121 (the first differences) gives the number added at the n-th round.
%C A160120 The Y-toothpick pattern has a recursive, fractal (or fractal-like) structure.
%C A160120 Note that, on the infinite triangular grid, a Y-toothpick can be represented as a polyedge with three components. In this case, at the n-th round, the structure is a polyedge with 3*a(n) components.
%C A160120 This structure is more complex than the toothpick structure of A139250. For example, at some rounds we can see inward growth.
%C A160120 The structure contains distinct polygons which have side length equal to 1.
%C A160120 Observation: It appears that the region of the structure where all grid points are covered is formed only by three distinct polygons:
%C A160120 - Triangles
%C A160120 - Rhombuses
%C A160120 - Concave-convex hexagons
%C A160120 Holes in the structure: Also, we can see distinct concave-convex polygons which contains a region where there are no grid points that are covered, for example:
%C A160120 - Decagons   (with  1 non-covered grid point)
%C A160120 - Dodecagons (with  4 non-covered grid points)
%C A160120 - 18-gons    (with  7 non-covered grid points)
%C A160120 - 30-gons    (with 26 non-covered grid points)
%C A160120 - ...
%C A160120 Observation: It appears that the number of distinct polygons that contain non-covered grid points is infinite.
%C A160120 This sequence appears to be related to powers of 2. For example:
%C A160120 Conjecture: It appears that if n = 2^k, k>0, then, between the other polygons, there appears a new centered hexagon formed by three rhombuses with side length = 2^k/2 = n/2.
%C A160120 Conjecture: Consider the perimeter of the structure. It appears that if n = 2^k, k>0, then the structure is a triangle-shaped polygon with A000225(k)*6 sides and a half toothpick in each vertice of the "triangle".
%C A160120 Conjecture: It appears that if n = 2^k, k>0, then the ratio of areas between the Y-toothpick structure and the unitary triangle is equal to A006516(k)*6.
%C A160120 See the entry A139250 for more information about the growth of "standard" toothpicks.
%C A160120 See also A160715 for another version of this structure but without internal growth of Y-toothpicks. [_Omar E. Pol_, May 31 2010]
%C A160120 For an alternative visualization replace every single toothpick with a rhombus, or in other words, replace every Y-toothpick with the "three-diamond" symbol, so we have a cellular automaton in which a(n) gives the total number of "three-diamond" symbols after n-th stage and A160167(n) counts the total number of "ON" diamonds in the structure after n-th stage. See also A253770. - _Omar E. Pol_, Dec 24 2015
%C A160120 The behavior is similar to A153006 (see the graph). - _Omar E. Pol_, Apr 03 2018
