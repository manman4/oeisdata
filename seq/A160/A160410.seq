%N A160410 Number of "ON" cells at n-th stage in simple 2-dimensional cellular automaton (see Comments for precise definition).
%C A160410 On the infinite square grid, we consider cells to be the squares, and we start at round 0 with all cells in the OFF state, so a(0) = 0.
%C A160410 At round 1, we turn ON four cells, forming a square.
%C A160410 The rule for n > 1: A cell in turned ON iff exactly one of its four vertices is a corner vertex of the set of ON cells. So in each generation every exposed vertex turns on three new cells.
%C A160410 Therefore:
%C A160410 At Round 2, we turn ON twelve cells around the square.
%C A160410 At round 3, we turn ON twelve other cells. Three cells around of every corner of the square.
%C A160410 And so on.
%C A160410 For the first differences see the entry A161411.
%C A160410 Shows a fractal behavior similar to the toothpick sequence A139250.
%C A160410 A very similar sequence is A160414, which uses the same rule but with a(1) = 1, not 4.
%C A160410 When n=2^k then the polygon formed by ON cells is a square with side length 2^(k+1).
%C A160410 a(n) is also the area of the figure of A147562 after n generations if A147562 is drawn as overlapping squares. - _Omar E. Pol_, Nov 08 2009
%C A160410 From _Omar E. Pol_, Mar 28 2011: (Start)
%C A160410 Also, toothpick sequence starting with four toothpicks centered at (0,0) as a cross.
%C A160410 Rule: Each exposed endpoint of the toothpicks of the old generation must be touched by the endpoints of three toothpicks of new generation. (Note that these three toothpicks looks like a T-toothpick, see A160172.)
%C A160410 The sequence gives the number of toothpicks after n stages. A161411 gives the number of toothpicks added at the n-th stage.

%e A160410 With the positive terms written as an irregular triangle in which the row lengths are the terms of A011782 the sequence begins:
%e A160410     4;
%e A160410    16;
%e A160410    28,  64;

%e A160410   ...
%e A160410 Right border gives the elements of A000302 greater than 1.
%e A160410 This triangle T(n,k) shares with the triangle A256534 the terms of the column k, if k is a power of 2, for example, both triangles share the following terms: 4, 16, 28, 64, 76, 112, 256, 268, 304, 448, 1024, etc.
