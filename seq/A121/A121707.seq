%N A121707 Numbers n > 1 such that n^3 divides Sum_{k=1..n-1} k^n = A121706(n).
%C A121707 All terms belong to A038509 (Composite numbers with smallest prime factor >= 5). Many but not all terms belong to A060976 (Odd nonprimes, c, which divide Bernoulli(2*c)).
%C A121707 Many terms are semiprimes:
%C A121707 - the non-semiprimes are {275, 455, 475, 539, 575, 715, 775, 875, 935, ...}: see A321487;
%C A121707 - semiprime terms that are multiples of 5 have indices {7, 11, 19, 23, 31, 43, 47, 59, 67, 71, 79, 83, ...} = A002145 (Primes of form 4*k + 3, except 3, or k > 0; or Primes which are also Gaussian primes);
%C A121707 - semiprime terms that are multiples of 7 have indices {5, 11, 17, 23, 29, 41, 47, 53, 59, 71, 83, 89, ...} = A003627 (Primes of form 3*k - 1, except 2, or k > 1);
%C A121707 - semiprime terms that are multiples of 11 have indices {5, 7, 13, 17, 19, 23, 37, 43, 47, 53, 59, 67, 73, 79, 83, ...} = Primes of the form 4*k + 1 and 4*k - 1. [Edited by _Michel Marcus_, Jul 21 2018, _M. F. Hasler_, Nov 09 2018]
%C A121707 Conjecture: odd numbers n > 1 such that n divides Sum_{k=1..n-1} k^(n-1). - _Thomas Ordowski_ and _Robert Israel_, Oct 09 2015. Professor Andrzej Schinzel (in a letter to me, dated Dec 29 2015) proved this conjecture. - _Thomas Ordowski_, Jul 20 2018
%C A121707 Note that n^2 divides Sum_{k=1..n-1} k^n for every odd number n > 1. - _Thomas Ordowski_, Oct 30 2015
%C A121707 Conjecture: these are "anti-Carmichael numbers" defined; n > 1 such that p - 1 does not divide n - 1 for every prime p dividing n. Equivalently, odd numbers n > 1 such that n is coprime to A027642(n-1). A number n > 1 is an "anti-Carmichael" if and only if gcd(n, b^n - b) = 1 for some integer b. - _Thomas Ordowski_, Jul 20 2018
%C A121707 It seems that these numbers are all composite terms of A317358. - _Thomas Ordowski_, Jul 30 2018
%C A121707 a(62) = 697 is the first term not in A267999: see A306097 for all these terms. - _M. F. Hasler_, Nov 09 2018
%C A121707 If the conjecture from _Thomas Ordowski_ is true, then no term is a multiple of 2 or 3. - _Jianing Song_, Jan 27 2019
%C A121707 Conjecture: an odd number n > 1 is a term iff gcd(n, A027642(n-1)) = 1. - _Thomas Ordowski_, Jul 19 2019
%C A121707 Conjecture: Sequence consists of numbers n > 1 such that r = b^n + n - b will produce a prime for one or more integers b > 1. Only when n is in this sequence do one or more prime factors of n fail to divide r for all b.  Also, n and b must be coprime for r to be prime. The above also applies to r = b^n - n - b, ignoring n=3, b=2. - _Richard R. Forberg_, Jul 18 2020
%C A121707 Odd numbers n > 1 such that Sum_{k(even)=2..n-1}2*k^(n-1) == 0 (mod n). - _Davide Rotondo_, Oct 28 2020
%C A121707 What is the asymptotic density of these numbers? The numbers A267999 have a slightly lower density. The difference between the densities is equal to the density of the numbers A306097. - _Thomas Ordowski_, Feb 15 2021
%C A121707 The asymptotic density of this sequence is in the interval (0.253, 0.265) (Ordowski, 2021). - _Amiram Eldar_, Feb 26 2021
