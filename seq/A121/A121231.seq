%N A121231 Number of n X n binary matrices M (that is, real matrices with entries 0 and 1) such that M^2 is also a binary matrix.
%C A121231 Equivalently, directed graphs (simple but loops allowed) without a few small forbidden subgraphs (those allowing 2 distinct paths of length 2 from vertex x to vertex y for some x,y; I think there are 6 possibilities). One can also consider isomorphism classes of those digraphs. - _Brendan McKay_, Aug 21 2006
%C A121231 From _Rob Pratt_, Aug 03 2008: (Start)
%C A121231 A121294 provides a lower bound on the maximum number of 1's in such a matrix M. There are cases where a higher number is reached; the following 5 X 5 matrix has 11 ones and its square is binary:
%C A121231   0 0 1 0 0
%C A121231   0 0 0 0 1
%C A121231   1 1 0 0 1
%C A121231   1 1 0 1 0
%C A121231   1 1 0 1 0.
%C A121231 The optimal values seem to match A070214, verified for n <= 7. (End)
%C A121231 Term (5,1) of the n-th power of the 5 X 5 matrix shown is A001045(n), the Jacobsthal sequence. - _Gary W. Adamson_, Oct 03 2008

%E A121231 a(7) from _R. H. Hardin_, Jun 19 2012. This makes it clear that the old A122527 was really a badly-described version of this sequence, and that a(7) was earlier found by Balakrishnan (bvarada2(AT)jhu.edu), Sep 17 2006. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Jun 19 2012
