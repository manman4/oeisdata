%N A213733 Positions of odd numbers in A179016.
%C A213733 These are exactly the positions in the infinite trunk of beanstalk (see A179016 and A213729) where the node is the larger of the two possible branches from one node below. See the explanation at example-lines.
%H A213733 Antti Karttunen, <a href="/A213733/b213733.txt">Table of n, a(n) for n = 1..10000</a>
%F A213733 a(n) = A218773(n)+1.
%e A213733 A179016(1) = 1 is the first case where the infinite trunk has continued to the larger of two branches of the predecessor node. (In this case the predecessor node is A179016(0)=0, for which hold both 0+A000120(0)=0+0=0 (the smaller branch, leading exceptionally back to the same node) and 0+A000120(1)=0+1=1 (the larger branch). Thus the first term of this sequence is 1.
%e A213733 A179016(2) = 3 is the second case where the infinite trunk has continued to the larger of two branches of the predecessor node (In this case the predecessor node is A179016(1)=1, for which hold both 1+A000120(2)=1+1=2 (the smaller branch) and 1+A000120(3)=1+2=3 (the larger branch). Thus the second term of this sequence is 2.
