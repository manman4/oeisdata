%N A213732 Positions of even numbers greater than zero in A179016.
%C A213732 These are exactly those positions in the infinite trunk of beanstalk (see A179016 and A213729) where the node is the smaller of the two possible branches from one node below.

%F A213732 a(n) = A218772(n)+1.
%e A213732 A179016(3) = 4 is the first case where the infinite trunk has continued to the smaller of two branches of the predecessor node. (In this case the predecessor node is A179016(2)=3, for which hold both 3+A000120(4)=3+1=4 (the smaller branch) and 3+A000120(5)=3+2=5 (the larger branch). Thus the first term of this sequence is 3.
%e A213732 A179016(5) = 8 is the second case where the infinite trunk has continued to the smaller of two branches of the predecessor node (In this case the predecessor node is A179016(4)=7, for which hold both 7+A000120(8)=7+1=8 (the smaller branch) and 7+A000120(9)=7+2=9 (the larger branch). Thus the second term of this sequence is 5.
