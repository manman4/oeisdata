%N A213730 After zero, gives the numbers where finite "side-trees" (or "tendrils") of beanstalk branch off from its infinite trunk (A179016).
%C A213730 These are the other branches branching off from the infinite trunk, than the ones that stay in that infinite trunk. These other branches are always finite, except for the zero in which case the other branch leads to 1, and the other branch (listed here) leads back to zero itself (as 0-A000120(0) = 0).
%C A213730 The terms include also those leaves (i.e. those terms of A055938) that are right next to the infinite trunk.
