%N A198380 Cycle type of the n-th finite permutation represented by index number of A194602.
%C A198380 This sequence shows the cycle type of each finite permutation (A195663) as the index number of the corresponding partition. (When a permutation has a 3-cycle and a 2-cycle, this corresponds to the partition 3+2, etc.) Partitions can be ordered, so each partition can be denoted by its index in this order, e.g. 6 for the partition 3+2. Compare A194602.
%C A198380 From the properties of A194602 follows:
%C A198380 Entries 1,2,4,6,10,14,21...     ( A000041(n)-1 from n=2 ) correspond to permutations with exactly one n-cycle (and no other cycles).
%C A198380 Entries 1,3,7,15,30,56,101...   ( A000041(2n-1) from n=1 ) correspond to permutations with exactly n 2-cycles (and no other cycles), so these are the symmetric permutations.
%C A198380 Entries n = 1,3,4,7,9,10,12...  ( A194602(n) has an even binary digit sum ) correspond to even permutations. This goes along with the fact, that a permutation is even when its partition contains an even number of even addends.
