%N A179126 Positive integers m for which the torsion subgroup of the elliptic curve y^2 = x^3 + m has order 3.
%C A179126 Apparently equal to the set of integers (A004709(k))^2, k>=2. [This is incorrect, as shown by the terms 256, 576, 1024, 1600, and 2304. - _Jianing Song_, Aug 25 2022]
%C A179126 From _Jianing Song_, Aug 25 2022: (Start)
%C A179126 Numbers which are perfect squares (A000290) but not perfect cubes (A000578). This follows from the complete description of the torsion group of y^2 = x^3 + n, using O to denote the point at infinity (see Exercise 10.19 of Chapter X of Silverman's Arithmetic of elliptic curves):
%C A179126 - If n = t^6 is a sixth power, then the torsion group consists of O, (2*t^2,+-3*t^3), (0,+-t^3), and (-t^2, 0).
%C A179126 - If n = t^2 is not a sixth power, then the torsion group consists of O and (0,+-t).
%C A179126 - If n = t^3 is not a sixth power, then the torsion group consists of O and (-t,0).
%C A179126 - If n is of the form -432*t^6, then the torsion group consists of O and (12*t^2,+-36*t^3).
%C A179126 - In all the other cases, the torsion group is trivial. (End)
