%N A179416 a(n)=1 if (n modulo 65536)+1 is a quadratic residue of 65537, 0 otherwise.
%C A179416 This sequence gives essentially the same information as A165471, but in contrast to it (and A165472), the period of this sequence is explicitly defined as 65536 (instead of 65537), so that in essence the zeros at A165471(k*65537) are silently skipped. Several derived sequences to be computed.
