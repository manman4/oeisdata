%N A179687 a(n) = 2*q(n)-1 where q(n) is the sequence of records positions of A179686.
%C A179687 The record positions are q(n) = 2, 3, 4, 10, 14, 19, 24, 27, 34,...
%C A179687 Sequences A179382, A179383, A179480, A179481, A179686 and this sequence show that their terms depend on prime power factorization of 2*n-1. Nevertheless, this question yet is waiting its research. Most likely that almost all terms of this sequence are primes (27, 95, 841,... are not).
