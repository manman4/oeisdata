%N A170943 Numbers k with the property that when 1/k is written in base 3 (in either of the two representations, if the representation is ambiguous) the fractional part contains no 1's.
%C A170943 That is, neither of the two representations of 1/k in base 3 contain a 1.
%C A170943 This is A121153 without the numbers 3^k, k >= 1. See that entry for further information.

%e A170943 1/3 in base 3 can be written as either .1 or .0222222... The first version contains a 1, so 3 is not in the sequence.
%e A170943 1/4 in base 3 is .02020202020..., so 4 is in the sequence.
