%N A170896 Number of ON cells after n generations of the Schrandt-Ulam cellular automaton on the square grid that is described in the Comments.
%C A170896 The cells are the squares of the standard square grid.
%C A170896 Cells are either OFF or ON, once they are ON they stay ON, and we begin in generation 1 with 1 ON cell.
%C A170896 Each cell has 4 neighbors, those that it shares an edge with. Cells that are ON at generation n all try simultaneously to turn ON all their neighbors that are OFF. They can only do this at this point in time; afterwards they go to sleep (but stay ON).
%C A170896 A square Q is turned ON at generation n+1 if:
%C A170896 a) Q shares an edge with one and only one square P (say) that was turned ON at generation n (in which case the two squares which intersect Q only in a vertex not on that edge are called Q's "outer squares"), and
%C A170896 b) Q's outer squares were not turned ON in any previous generation.
%C A170896 c) In addition, of this set of prospective squares of the (n+1)th generation satisfying the previous condition, we eliminate all squares which are outer squares of other prospective squares.
%C A170896 A151895, A151906, and A267190 are closely related cellular automata.
