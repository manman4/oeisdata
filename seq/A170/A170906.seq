%N A170906 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) = number of cells that are turned from OFF to ON at stage k of the cellular automaton in the 30-60-90 triangle of hexagons defined in Comments.
%C A170906 Consider the tiling of the plane by hexagons, where each cell has 6 neighbors, as in the A151723, A151724, A170905.
%C A170906 Assume the hexagons are oriented so that each one has a pair of vertical edges.
%C A170906 Consider the (30 deg., 60 deg., 90 deg.) triangle of hexagons with n hexagons along the short side, along the X-axis, 2n-1 hexagons along the hypotenuse and n hexagons separated by single edges along the middle side, along the Y-axis.
%C A170906 Initially all cells are OFF. At stage 1, the cell in the 60-degree corner is turned ON; thereafter, a cell is turned ON if it has exactly one ON neighbor in the triangle. Once a cell is ON it stays ON.
%C A170906 T(n,k) is the number of cells that are turned from OFF to ON at stage k (1 <= k <= 2n-1).
%C A170906 The rows converge to A170905. The rows sums give A170907.
%C A170906 Row n contains 2n-1 terms.
%C A170906 I wish I had a recurrence for this sequence!
