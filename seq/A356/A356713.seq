%N A356713 Numbers k such that Mordell's equation y^2 = x^3 - k^3 has exactly 1 integral solution.
%C A356713 Numbers k such that Mordell's equation y^2 = x^3 - k^3 has no solution other than the trivial solution (k,0).
%C A356713 Cube root of A179163.
%C A356713 Contains all squares: suppose that y^2 = x^3 - t^6, then (y/t^3)^2 = (x/t^2)^3 - 1. The elliptic curve Y^2 = X^3 - 1 has rank 0 and the only rational points on it are (1,0), so y^2 = x^3 - t^6 has only one solution (t^2,0).
