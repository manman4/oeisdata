%N A147614 a(n) = number of grid points that are covered after n-th stage of A139250, assuming the toothpicks have length 2.
%C A147614 a(n) is also the number of "ON" cells at n-th stage in simple 2-dimensional cellular automaton whose virtual skeleton is a polyedge as the toothpick structure of A139250. [From _Omar E. Pol_, May 18 2009]
%C A147614 It appears that the number of grid points that are covered after n-th stage of A139250, assuming the toothpicks have length 2*k, is equal to (2*k-2) * A139250(n) + a(n), k>0. See formulas in A160420 and A160422. [From _Omar E. Pol_, Nov 15 2010]
%C A147614 More generally, it appears that a(n) is also the number of grid points that are covered by the "special points" of the toothpicks of A139250, after n-th stage, assuming the toothpicks have length 2*k, k>0 and that each toothpick has three special points: the midpoint and two endpoints.
%C A147614 Note that if k>1 then also there are 2*k-2 grid points that are covered by each toothpick, but these points are not considered for this sequence. [From _Omar E. Pol_, Nov 15 2010]
%C A147614 Contribution from _Omar E. Pol_, Sep 16 2012 (Start):
%C A147614 It appears that a(n)/A139250(n) converge to 4/3.
%C A147614 It appears that a(n)/A160124(n) converge to 2.
%C A147614 It appears that a(n)/A139252(n) converge to 4.

%F A147614 Since A160124(n) = 1+2*A139250(n)-A147614(n), n>0 (see A160124), and we have recurrences for A160125 (hence A160124) and A139250, we have a recurrence for this sequence. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Feb 02 2010
