%N A183148 Toothpick sequence on the semi-infinite square grid with toothpicks connected by their endpoints.
%C A183148 On the semi-infinite square grid we start with no toothpicks.
%C A183148 At stage 1 we place a single toothpick of length 1 which has one of its endpoints on the straight line.
%C A183148 New generations of toothpicks are added according to these rules: each exposed endpoint of toothpicks of the old generation must be touched by the 3 endpoints of three toothpicks of the new generation. Effectively these three toothpicks look like a T-toothpick (see A160172). The straight line that delimits the square grid acts like an impenetrable "absorbing" boundary: toothpicks may touch this line with at most one of their endpoints; these endpoints are not "exposed."
%C A183148 The sequence gives the number of toothpicks in the toothpick structure after n-th stage. The first differences (A183149) give the number of toothpicks added at n-th stage.

%F A183148 a(n) = 3*A183060(n-1) + 1.
%e A183148 At stage 1 place an orthogonal toothpick with one of its endpoints on the infinite straight line, so a(1) = 1. There is only one exposed endpoint.
%e A183148 At stage 2 place 3 toothpicks such that the structure looks like a cross, so a(2) = 1+3 = 4. There are 3 exposed endpoints.
%e A183148 At stage 3 place 9 toothpicks, so a(3) = 4+9 = 13. There are 3 exposed endpoints.
%e A183148 At stage 4 place 9 toothpicks, so a(4) = 13+9 = 22. There are 7 exposed endpoints.
