%N A183004 Toothpick sequence on square grid with toothpicks connected by their endpoints.
%C A183004 Rules:
%C A183004 - If n is odd then each new toothpick must lie in vertical direction.
%C A183004 - If n is even then each new toothpick must lie in horizontal direction.
%C A183004 - Each exposed endpoint of the toothpicks of the old generation must be touched by the endpoints of two toothpicks of new generation.
%C A183004 The sequence gives the number of toothpicks after n stages. A183005 (the first differences) gives the number added at the n-th stage.
%C A183004 The structure is very similar to the structure of A139250 but the mechanism for the connection of toothpicks is different.

%F A183004 We start at stage 0 with no toothpicks.
%F A183004 At stage 1, place a single toothpick of length 1 on a square grid, aligned with the y-axis, so a(1)=1. There are two exposed endpoints.
%F A183004 At stage 2, place 4 toothpicks in horizontal position: two new toothpicks touching each exposed endpoint, so a(2)=1+4=5. There are 4 exposed endpoints.
%F A183004 At stage 3, place 6 toothpicks in vertical position, so a(3)=5+6=11.
%F A183004 After 3 stages the toothpick structure has 2 squares and 4 exposed endpoints.
%Y A183004 Cf. A139250, A160164, A182840, A183005.
