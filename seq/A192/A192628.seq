%N A192628 Nonvanishing exponents of the reciprocal of the modulo 2 generating function for the sum-of-divisor function.
%C A192628 Consider sigma, the sum-of-positive-divisor function with s(0) := 1.  Let Sigma(q) be the *binary* generating function for sigma, namely
%C A192628 Sigma(q) := sigma(0)q^0 + sigma(1)q^1 + sigma(2)q^2 + sigma(3)q^3 + sigma(4)q^4 + ...
%C A192628 More precisely, we require that Sigma(q) is binary in the sense of reducing all coefficients modulo 2.  Thus, the coefficient of q^k is 0 if sigma(k) is even, odd otherwise.  One could equivalently define Sigma(q) to be the sum of all q^k (for k nonnegative) such that sigma(k) is odd.  The terms of the given sequence are the exponents of the nonvanishing monomials of the reciprocal 1/Sigma(q).  Other equivalent definitions for this sequence can be discovered through appeals to representation theory.
%C A192628 Density upper bound: 1/16.  Conjectured density: 1/32.  Contains only 0 and positive integers congruent to 1 and 3 (mod 8) and 7 (mod 16).
%C A192628 Congruence class:
%C A192628 *0 (mod 8): 0, density 0
%C A192628 *1 (mod 8): odd squares, density 0
%C A192628 *3 (mod 8): integers of the form (p^e)(k^2) for p prime congruent to 3 (mod 8), e congruent to 1 (mod 4), and k odd and coprime to p, density 0
%C A192628 *7 (mod 16): conjectured density 1/32 with upper bound 1/16.
%C A192628 After a(0)=0, these are the positive integers which have an odd number of representations as a sum of positive integers which have odd divisor sum.  A positive integer k has odd divisor sum if and only if k is a square or twice a square (A028982).  For example, a(2) = 3 can be represented as: 2+1, 1+2, or 1+1+1, 3 representations
