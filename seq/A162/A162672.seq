%N A162672 Lunar product 19*n.
%C A162672 Since 19 is the smallest lunar prime, this is a kind of lunar analog of the even numbers.
%C A162672 As the b-file shows, this sequence is not monotonic and contains repetitions.

%F A162672 For a two-digit number n, the lunar product 19*n is obtained by putting a 1 in front of n.
%e A162672 19 * 3 = 13, so 13 is a member. 1109 has just two divisors, 9 and 109, so 1109 is not a member.
