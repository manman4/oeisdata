%N A162795 Total number of toothpicks in the toothpick structure A139250 that are parallel to the initial toothpick, after n odd rounds.
%C A162795 Partial sums of A162793.
%C A162795 Also, total number of ON cells at stage n of the two-dimensional cellular automaton defined as follows: replace every "vertical" toothpick of length 2 with a centered unit square "ON" cell, so we have a cellular automaton which is similar to both A147562 and A169707 (this is the "one-step bishop" version). For the "one-step rook" version we use toothpicks of length sqrt(2), then rotate the structure 45 degrees and then replace every toothpick with a unit square "ON" cell. For the illustration of the sequence as a cellular automaton we now have three versions: the original version with toothpicks, the one-step rook version and one-step bishop version. Note that the last two versions refer to the standard ON cells in the same way as the two versions of A147562 and the two versions of A169707. It appears that the graph of this sequence lies between the graphs of A147562 and A169707. Also, it appears that this sequence shares infinitely many terms with both A147562 and A169707, see Formula section and Example section. - _Omar E. Pol_, Feb 20 2015
%C A162795 It appears that this is also a bisection (the odd terms) of A255747.
