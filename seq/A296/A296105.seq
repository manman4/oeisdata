%N A296105 a(n) is the number of connected transitive relations over n unlabeled nodes.
%C A296105 Inverse Euler transform of A091073. Here "connected" means that it is possible to reach any vertex starting from any other vertex by traversing edges in some direction, i.e., not necessarily in the direction in which the edges point, as in weakly connected digraphs.
%e A296105 a(2) = 5 because there are five connected transitive relations up to isomorphism: a->b with no loops, a->b with a loop on a, a->b with a loop on b, a->b->a with no loops, and a->b->a with loops on both a and b.
