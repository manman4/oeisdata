%F A128984 Recursion relation:f(0)=2, f(2)=4, f(3)=6, f(4)=12, f(5)=f(1)+f(2)+f(3)+f(4)/f(0), f(n)=f(n-1)+f(n-2)+f(n-3)+f(n-4)-f(n-5)/f(0)-f(n-5), n>5 and provided the difference between consecutive numbers (before and at the start of the addition) does not exceed four digits. If however, this difference (m-(m-1)<=4 the f(n)=f(n-1)+f(n-2)+f(n-3)+f(n-4)/f(0)-f(n-4). [Indices need to be changed to match the offset. - _R. J. Mathar_, Dec 04 2011]
