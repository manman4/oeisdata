%N A174205 Write natural numbers in base 2 as a stream of digits. Moving left to right, delete odd occurrences of digit 0 and 1.
%C A174205 The natural numbers in base 2 are 0, 1, 10, 11, 100, 101, 110, 111, 1000..... and define a stream of digits if concatenated:
%C A174205 0110111001011101111000 Delete odd-indexed occurrences of 0 (replaced by .):
%C A174205 .110111.01.11101111.0. Also delete odd-indexed occurrences of 1 (replaced by .):
%C A174205 ..10.1..01..1.01.1..0.
%C A174205 The stream of bits that remain after these two rounds of deletion is chopped into single bits which define the entries of the current sequence.
