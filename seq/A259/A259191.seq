%N A259191 Number of integral solutions to y^2 = x^3 + n*x^2 + n (with y nonnegative).
%C A259191 If n is square there are at least two solutions, corresponding to x = 0 and x = -n. If n = 2^(2k) there are at least three solutions, corresponding to x = 0, x = -2^(2k), and x = 2^(6k-2) + 2^(2k). If n = 2k^2 + 2k, there is at least one solution, corresponding to x = 1.
