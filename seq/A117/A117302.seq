%N A117302 Number of cases in which the first player gets killed in a Russian roulette game when 7 players use a gun with n chambers and the number of the bullets can be from 1 to n. In the game they do not rotate the cylinder after the game starts.
%C A117302 We denote by U[7,n,m] the number of cases that the first player gets killed in a Russian roulette game when 7 players use a gun with n chambers and m bullets. They never rotate the cylinder after the game starts. The chambers can be represented by the list {1,2,...,n}. We are going to calculate (0), (1), ..., (t) separately. (0) The first player gets killed when one bullet is in the first chamber and the remaining (m-1) bullets are in {2,3,...,n}. We have binomial(n-1,m-1) cases for this. (1) The first gets killed when one bullet is in the 8th chamber and the rest of the bullets are in {9,..,n}. We have binomial(n-8,m-1) cases for this. We continue to calculate and the last is (t), where t = floor((n-m)/7). (t) The first gets killed when one bullet is in (7t+1)-st chamber and the remaining bullets are in {7t+2,...,n}. We have binomial(n-7t-1,m-1) cases for this. Therefore U[7,n,m] = Sum_{z=0..t} binomial(n-7z-1,m-1), where t = floor((n-m)/7). Let A[7,n] be the number of cases in which the first player gets killed when 7 players use a gun with n chambers and the number of bullets can be from 1 to n. Then A[7,n] = Sum_{m=1..n} U[7,n,m].

%e A117302 If the number of chambers is 3, then the number of the bullets can be 1,2,3. The first one get killed when one bullet is in the first chamber and the remaining bullets are in the second and the third chamber. All the cases are {{1, 0, 0}, {1, 1, 0}, {1, 0, 1}, {1, 1, 1}}, where we denote by 1 the chamber that contains the bullet. Therefore a(3) = 4.
