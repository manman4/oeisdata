%N A329680 Number of excursions of length n with Motzkin-steps consisting only of consecutive steps UH, HD and DU.
%C A329680 The Motzkin step set is U=(1,1), H=(1,0) and D=(1,-1). An excursion is a path starting at (0,0), ending on the x-axis and never crossing the x-axis, i.e., staying at nonnegative altitude.
%C A329680 This sequence is periodic with a pre-period of length 2 (namely 1, 1) and a period of length 3 (namely 0, 1, 0).
%H A329680 <a href="/index/Rec#order_03">Index entries for linear recurrences with constant coefficients</a>, signature (0,0,1).
%F A329680 G.f.: (1+t-t^4)/(1-t^3).
%F A329680 a(n) = A173857(n). - _R. J. Mathar_, Dec 06 2019
%e A329680 For n=3k we have one excursion of this type, namely (UHD)^k. Furthermore, we have a(1)=1, since the excursion H is allowed.
%t A329680 PadRight[{1, 1}, 100, {1, 0, 0}] (* _Paolo Xausa_, Sep 28 2025 *)
%Y A329680 Cf. A329682, A329683, A329684.
%Y A329680 Essentially the same as A079978 and A022003.
