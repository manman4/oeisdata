%N A329682 Number of excursions of length n with Motzkin-steps forbidding all consecutive steps of length 2 except UH, UD, HU and DD.
%C A329682 The Motzkin step set is U=(1,1), H=(1,0) and D=(1,-1). An excursion is a path starting at (0,0), ending on the x-axis and never crossing the x-axis, i.e., staying at nonnegative altitude.
%C A329682 This sequence is periodic with a pre-period of length 2 (namely 1, 1) and a period of length 3 (namely 1, 1, 0).
%C A329682 Decimal expansion of 11099/99900. - _Elmo R. Oliveira_, Jun 16 2024
%H A329682 <a href="/index/Rec#order_03">Index entries for linear recurrences with constant coefficients</a>, signature (0,0,1).
%F A329682 G.f.: (1+t+t^2-t^4)/(1-t^3).
%F A329682 a(n) = a(n-3) for n > 4. - _Elmo R. Oliveira_, Jun 16 2024
%e A329682 a(6) = 1 because we only have one such excursion of length 6, namely UHUDDD. Similarly a(8) = 1, since only UHUHUDDD is allowed.
%e A329682 More generally, the only possibilities are (HU)^kD^k, U(HU)^(k-1)D^k (aside from trivial cases of length zero or one).
%t A329682 PadRight[{1, 1}, 100, {1, 0, 1}] (* _Paolo Xausa_, Sep 28 2025 *)
%Y A329682 Cf. A329680, A329683, A329684.
