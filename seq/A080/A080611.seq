%N A080611 a(n) is the smallest number m >= 2 for which the set of prime factors of m, m-1 and m+1 contains at least the first n primes.
%C A080611 This sequence is of use in non-decimal systems whereby digits in base a(n) can be tested using simple addition tricks [and no higher operations] to determine if the number represented is relatively prime with respect to the first n primes.
%C A080611 The addition trick for base a(n) is to sum digits to do a(n)-1 divisibility tests and alternately add and subtract digits to perform the a(n)+1 test. In base 10 we add digits to find 9-divisibility or add-subtract digits (e.g. 132 = 2-3+1 = 0 is divisible by 11) to find divisibility by 11.
%C A080611 a(5) = 21 because 20, 21 and 22 have between them all 5 prime factors 2,3,5,7,11. - _Don Reble_, Feb 27 2003

%F A080611 a(n) is the smallest number such that the product (a(n)-1) * a(n) * (a(n)+1) has prime factors which include the first n ordinal primes (see A033946).
%e A080611 a(1) = 1 since we assume 0 and 1 have no nontrivial prime factors, thus a(1)+1 is the only term with factors, {2}.
%e A080611 a(4) = 6 because a(4)-1 = 5, thus the set of prime factors {5}; a(4) = 2*3, thus the set of prime factors {2, 3} and a(4)+1 = 7 with the set of prime factors {7}. The combined set, {2, 3, 5, 7} contains the first 4 prime numbers (not including 1) and because there are no numbers less than 6 with this property, a(4) = 6.
