%C A080580 Also, positions of 0 in A284939; complement of A284941. - _R. J. Mathar_, Apr 24 2017
%C A080580 Proof that this is the same as the positions of 0 in A284939, from _Joe Slater_, Apr 26 2017: (Start)
%C A080580 The sequence A284939 consists of a concatenation of the words 01 and 1101, each word representing a single term from the previous iteration of the transformation taken in order.
%C A080580 Because the sequence has reached its fixed point we don't need to compare these words to the terms of the previous iteration: we can actually relate the present iteration to itself.
%C A080580 Thus the following table relates terms of A284939 to its words. We would end up with the same sequence by concatenating either the terms or the words:
%C A080580    0 -> 01
%C A080580    1 -> 1101
%C A080580    1 -> 1101
%C A080580    1 -> 1101
%C A080580    0 -> 01
%C A080580    1 -> 1101
%C A080580    ... ...
%C A080580 Consider any arbitrary term A284939(n) and its successor A284939(n+1). They relate to the n-th and (n+1)-st words, and since neither of the possible words have sequential zeros there are only three possibilities for the two terms (0,1; 1,0; and 1,1) and therefore three possibilities for the words: 01 1101, 1101 01, or 1101 1101.
%C A080580 We can see that the only time there is a gap of three 1's between the first and second zeros will be when the two terms A284939(n) and A284939(n+1) are (1,0). Therefore, if the n-th zero of the sequence (corresponding to the term A284939(n)) is at position k, it will be followed by a zero at position k+2 if the term A284939(n+1)=0, but otherwise it will be followed by a zero at position k+4.
%C A080580 Let's relate this to the present sequence A080580:
%C A080580 We know sequence A284939 starts with a zero in position 1 (i.e., A284939(1)=0), so we can make a sequence S (say) listing the position of the zeros with S(1)=1. From our earlier discussion we know that the n-th zero of A284939 relates to the n-th term of A284939. Therefore, if S(n)=k, the following term S(n+1) will be +4 if A284939(n+1)=1 and +2 if A284939(n+1)=0.
%C A080580 But we don't actually need to refer to A284939 at all! When we come to S(n+1) we can just see whether n+1 appears in our sequence. If the number n+1 already appears in S then we know that A284939(n+1)=0, so S(n+1)=S(n)+2. If the number n+1 does not appear in S then we know that A284939(n+1)=1, so S(n+1)=S(n)+4.
%C A080580 This rule is exactly the rule of A080580, which means that A080580 and S are identical, and A080580 manages to predict the positions of the zeros in A284939 without ever referring to the sequence itself.  QED
