%N A336795 Incrementally largest values of minimal x satisfying the equation x^2 - D*y^2 = 3, where D is a prime number.
%C A336795 Analogous to A033315 for x^2 - D*y^2 = 1, and D required to be prime.

%e A336795 For D=73, the least x for which x^2 - D*y^2 = 3 has a solution is 94. The next prime, D, for which x^2 - D*y^2 = 3 has a solution is 97, but the smallest x in this case is 10, which is less than 94. The next prime, D, after 97 for which x^2 - D*y^2 = 3 has a solution is 109 and the least x for which it has a solution is 9532, which is larger than 94, so it is a new record value. 73 is a term of A336794 and 94 is a term of this sequence, but 97 is not a term of A336794 because the least x for which x^2 - 97*y^2 = 3 has a solution is not a record value.
%Y A336795 Cf. A033315, A336794.
