%N A336796 Value of prime number D for incrementally largest values of minimal y satisfying the equation x^2 - D*y^2 = 3.
%C A336796 Is 61 the only term where this differs from A336794? - _R. J. Mathar_, Feb 16 2021

%e A336796 For D=13, the least positive y for which x^2-D*y^2=3 has a solution is 1. The next prime, D, for which x^2-D*y^2=3 has a solution is 61, but the smallest positive y in this case is also 1, which is equal to the previous record y. So, 61 is not a term.
%e A336796 The next prime, D, after 61 for which x^2-D*y^2=3 has a solution is 73, and the least positive y for which it has a solution in this case is y=11, which is larger than 1, so it is a new record y value. So, 73 is a term in this sequence and 11 is a term in A336800.
%Y A336796 Cf. A033316 (analog for x^2-D*y^2=1), A336790 (similar sequence for x's), A336800, A336794.
