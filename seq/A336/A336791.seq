%N A336791 Incrementally largest values of minimal x satisfying the equation x^2 - D*y^2 = -2, where D is an odd prime number.
%C A336791 Analogous to A033315 for x^2-D*y^2=1, and D required to be prime.

%e A336791 For D=43, the least x for which x^2-D*y^2=-2 has a solution is 59. The next prime, D, for which x^2-D*y^2=-2 has a solution is 59, but the smallest x in this case is 23, which is less than 59. The next prime, D, after 59 for which x^2-D*y^2=-2 has a solution is 67 and the least x for which it has a solution is 221, which is larger than 59, so it is a new record value. 67 is a term of A336790 and 221 is a term of this sequence, but 59 is not a term of A336790 because the least x for which x^2-47*y^2=-2 has a solution at D=59 is not a record value.
