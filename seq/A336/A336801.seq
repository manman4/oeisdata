%N A336801 Value of prime number D for incrementally largest values of minimal x satisfying the equation x^2 - D*y^2 = -3.
%C A336801 Analogous to A033316 for x^2 - D*y^2 = 1, and D is required to be prime, and for record values of x.

%e A336801 For D=13, the least x for which x^2 - D*y^2 = -3 has a solution is 7. The next prime, D, for which x^2 - D*y^2 = -3 has a solution is 19, but the smallest x in this case is 4, which is less than 7. The next prime, D, after 19 for which x^2 - D*y^2 = -3 has a solution is 31 and the least x for which it has a solution is 11, which is larger than 7, so it is a new record value. D=13 is a term of this sequence and x=7 is a term of A341076, but D=19 is not a term here because at D=19 the least x for which x^2 - D*y^2 = -3 has a solution is not a record value.
