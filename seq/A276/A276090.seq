%N A276090 Left inverse of A276089: For n = sum_{i=1..} d(i)*i! (with each d(i) <= i), a(n) = sum_{j=1..} d(2j-1)*j!.
%C A276090 This "deaerates" A276089(n) by picking only the digits from the odd positions of its factorial base representation. Of course, when computed for an arbitrary n, those digits, when  "compressed" into a(n) are not necessarily valid digits in standard factorial base representation (A007623).

%F A276090 Other identities. For all n >= 0:
%F A276090 a(A276089(n)) = n.
%e A276090 For n = 311 ("22321" in factorial base representation) we pick the digits at odd positions 1, 3 and 5, thus we get a(311) = 2*3! + 3*2! + 1*1! = 19.
%e A276090 For n=373 ("30201"), we pick the digits from those same positions and construct a(373) = 3*3! + 2*2! + 1*1! = 23.
