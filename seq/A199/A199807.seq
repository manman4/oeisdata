%N A199807 Sorted number of vertices of distinct solutions in the mix of 2 or 3 regular convex 4-polytopes.

%e A199807 a(1) = 40 because the mix of the pentatope {3,3,3} and the 16-cell hyperoctahedron {3,3,4} has 40 vertices, 480 edges, 1920 faces, 960 polyhedral facets, and an automorphism group of order 23040, and is itself polytopal (not every mix of polytope and polytope is a polytope).
