%N A227737 n occurs as many times as there are runs in binary representation of n.
%C A227737 a(n) = the least integer k such that A173318(k) >= n, which implies that each n occurs A005811(n) times.
%C A227737 Although as such quite uninteresting, this sequence is useful for computing irregular tables like A101211, A227736, A227738 and A227739.

%e A227737 1 has one run in its binary representation "1", thus 1 occurs once.
%e A227737 2 has two runs in its binary representation "10", thus 2 occurs twice.
%e A227737 3 has one run in its binary representation "11", thus 3 occurs only once.
%e A227737 4 has two runs in its binary representation "100", thus 4 occurs twice.
%e A227737 5 has three runs in its binary representation "101", thus 5 occurs three times.
%e A227737 The sequence thus begins as 1, 2,2, 3, 4,4, 5,5,5, ...
