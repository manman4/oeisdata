%N A187214 Number of gulls (or G-toothpicks) added at n-th stage in the first quadrant of the gullwing structure of A187212.
%C A187214 It appears that both a(2) and a(2^k - 1) are odd numbers, for k >= 2. Other terms are even numbers.

%F A187214 a(1)=0. a(n) = A187213(n)/2, for n >= 2.
%F A187214 It appears that a(2^k - 1) = A099035(k-1), for k >= 2.
%e A187214 At stage 1 we start in the first quadrant from a Q-toothpick centered at (1,0) with its endpoints at (0,0) and (1,1). There are no gulls in the structure, so a(1) = 0.
%e A187214 At stage 2 we place a gull (or G-toothpick) with its midpoint at (1,1) and its endpoints at (2,0) and (2,2), so a(2) = 1. There is only one exposed midpoint at (2,2).
%e A187214 At stage 3 we place a gull with its midpoint at (2,2), so a(3) = 1. There are two exposed endpoints.
%e A187214 At stage 4 we place two gulls, so a(4) = 2. There are two exposed endpoints.
%e A187214 At stage 5 we place two gulls, so a(5) = 2. There are four exposed endpoints.
%e A187214 And so on.
