%N A187212 Q-toothpick sequence in the first quadrant.
%C A187212 At stage 0, we start with no Q-toothpicks.
%C A187212 At stage 1, we place a Q-toothpick centered at (1,0) with its endpoints at (0,0) and (1,1).
%C A187212 At stage 2, we place two Q-toothpicks.
%C A187212 The sequence gives the number of Q-toothpicks in the structure after n-th stage.
%C A187212 For more information see A187210.
%C A187212 A187213 gives the number of Q-toothpicks added at n-th stage.
%C A187212 Note that starting from (0,1), with the first Q-toothpick centered at (1,1), we have the toothpick sequence A139250.
%C A187212 Also, gullwing sequence on the semi-infinite square grid, since a "gull" is formed by two Q-toothpicks. The sequence gives the number of "gulls" (or G-toothpicks) in the structure after n-th stage. See A187220. - Omar E. Pol, Mar 30 2011
