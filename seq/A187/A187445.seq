%N A187445 Number of ways to choose two elements from the multiset representative corresponding to the k-th multiset repetition class defining partition of n in Abramowitz-Stegun order.
%C A187445 This array a(n,k), called (Multiset choose 2), is also denoted by MS(2;n,k).
%C A187445 MS(2;n,k) gives the number of ways to choose two elements from the multiset encoded by the k-th multiset repetition class defining partition of n. The Abramowitz-Stegun (A-St) order for partitions is used (see A036036).
%C A187445 The row lengths of this array are A007294(n).
%C A187445 For the characteristic array of multiset repetition class defining partitions of n in A-St order see A176723.
%C A187445 This is the second member of an l-family of arrays for multiset choose l, called MS(l;n,k).
%C A187445 For a list of the multiset repetition class defining partitions of n=1..15 see the link under A176725. For n=0 the empty partition appears.
%C A187445 Note that multiset choose k should not be confused with N multichoose k (see, e.g., Wolfram's Mathworld). Here one picks from a multiset k=2 of its elements.
%C A187445 Ordinary sets appear exactly for n=T(N), N>=1, with the triangular numbers T(N):=A000217(N). They are defined by the partitions 1,2,...,N, and a(T(N),1)= binomial(N,2).
%D A187445 See A176725.
%F A187445 a(n,k) gives the number of ways to choose two elements from the multiset defined by the k-th multiset defining partition of n, with k=1..A007294(n).
%F A187445 a(n,k) = binomial(MS(1;n,k)+1,2) - m(n,k)[1], with MS(1;n,k):=A176725(n,k), and m(n,k)[1] the first member of the multiplicity list m(n,k) of the exponents of the k-th multiset defining partition of n.

%e A187445 a(6,2) = MS(2;6,2) = 3 because the second multiset repetition class defining partition of n=6 is 1^2,2^2 (from the characteristic array A176723) encoding the 4-multiset representative {1,1,2,2}, and there are 3 ways to choose 2 elements from this set, namely 1,1; 2,2; and 1,2.
%e A187445 a(T(4),1) = a(10,1) = MS(2;10,1) = 6, from the ordinary set {1,2,3,4} (defined by the multiset repetition class defining partition 1,2,3,4), coinciding with binomial(4,2).
%e A187445 a(8,2) = 3 = binomial(2+1,2) - 0, because the relevant partition has exponents [4,2] (corresponding to the 6-multiset {1,1,1,1,2,2}) with MS(1;8,2) = 2, and the multiplicity list of the exponents is m(8,2)=[0,1,0,1], hence m(8,2)[1]=0.
%e A187445 a(10,3) = 4 = binomial(3+1,2) - 2, corresponding to the 7-multiset {1,1,1,1,1,2,3} with MS(1;10,3) = 3 and exponents [5,1,1] with multiplicity m(10,3)=[2,0,0,0,1], hence m(10,3)[1]=2.
