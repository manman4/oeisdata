%N A187216 Q-toothpick sequence starting with two opposite Q-toothpicks centered at the same grid point.
%C A187216 The sequence gives the number of Q-toothpicks in the structure after n-th stage.
%C A187216 A187217 (the first differences) gives the number of Q-toothpicks added at n-th stage.
%C A187216 Note that in the Q-toothpick structure sometimes there is also an internal growth of Q-toothpicks.
%C A187216 For more information see A187210.

%e A187216 On the infinite square grid at stage 0 we start with no Q-toothpicks.
%e A187216 At stage 1 we place two opposite Q-toothpicks centered at (0,0). One of the Q-toothpicks lies on the first quadrant with its endpoints at (0,1) and (1,0). The other Q-toothpick lies on the third quadrant with its endpoints at (0,-1) and (-1,0). So a(1) = 2. There are 4 exposed endpoints.
%e A187216 At stage 2 we place 6 Q-toothpicks, so a(2) = 2+6 = 8.
%e A187216 At stage 3 we place 8 Q-toothpicks, so a(3) = 8+8 = 16.
%e A187216 At stage 4 we place 14 Q-toothpicks, so a(4) = 16+14 = 30.
%e A187216 After 4 stages in the Q-toothpick structure there are 1 circle, 2 "heads" and 12 exposed endpoints.
