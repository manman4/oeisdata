%N A340318 Minimum size of a partial order that contains all partial orders of size n.
%C A340318 a(n) is the minimum number of elements in a poset P such that every poset of size n is isomorphic to a subset of P, where the subset inherits the order from P.
%C A340318 Elementary bounds are a(n) >= 2n-1 because it must contain a chain and an antichain, and a(n) <= 2^n-1 because every partial order embeds into the powerset partial order on n elements. It is shown in the MathOverflow link that a(n) has no polynomial upper bound. This is in particular derived from binomial(a(n),n) >= A000112(n).
%C A340318 a(4) = 8 verified using a computer-assisted proof with a SAT solver.
%C A340318 a(5) = 11 proven on MathOverflow.
%C A340318 a(6) = 16 and 16 <= a(7) <= 25 proven on MathOverflow. - _Jukka Kohonen_, Jan 15 2021

%e A340318 a(2) = 3 because there are 2 nonisomorphic posets on two elements, and both embed into the poset of three elements {a, b, c} with ordering a < b (and other pairs are incomparable).
%e A340318 a(3) = 5 because all posets on three elements can be embedded into {a, b, c, d, e} with ordering a < d, b < c < d, and b < e.
