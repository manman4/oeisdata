%N A036436 Numbers whose number of divisors is a square.
%C A036436 Invented by the HR (named after Hardy and Ramanujan) concept formation program.
%C A036436 Numbers in this sequence but not in A036455 are 1, 1260, 1440, 1800, 1980, etc. - _R. J. Mathar_, Oct 20 2008
%C A036436 tau(p^(n^2-1)) = n^2 so numbers of this form are in this sequence, and because tau is multiplicative: if a and b are in this sequence and (a,b) = 1 then a*b is also in a(n). - _Enrique PÃ©rez Herrero_, Jan 22 2013
%C A036436 What is the density of this sequence? It contains A030229 and thus has (lower) density at least 3/Pi^2 = 0.30396...; it does not contain any members of A030059 or A060687, and hence has (upper) density at most 1 - 3/Pi^2 - 6*A179119/Pi^2 = 0.49528.... - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Jan 11 2025
%C A036436 The asymptotic density of this sequence is Sum_{k in A001694, A000005(k) in A028982} f(k) = 0.35787373..., where f(k) = (3/(Pi^2*k)) * Product_{prime p|k} (p/(p+1)). - _Amiram Eldar_, Oct 07 2025
