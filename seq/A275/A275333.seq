%N A275333 Triangle read by rows, the break statistic on orbital systems over n sectors.
%C A275333 The definition of an orbital system is given in A232500. The number of orbitals over n sectors is counted by the swinging factorial A056040.
%C A275333 The break index of an orbital is the sum of the positions of the up steps that are immediately followed by a step which is not an up step. This statistic is an extension of the major index statistic given in A063746 which appears as the even numbered rows here. This reflects the fact that the swinging factorial can be seen as an extension of the central binomial. The break index is different from the major index of the swinging factorial (which is in A274888).

%e A275333 T(5, 5) = 3 because the three orbitals [1, -1, -1, 1, 0], [1, -1, 0, 1, -1] and [1, 0, -1, 1, -1] have at position 1 and position 4 an up-step which is immediately followed by a step which is not an up-step.
