%N A308747 Number of achiral m-color cyclic compositions of n (that is, number of cyclic compositions of n with reflection symmetry where each part of size m can be colored with one of m colors).
%C A308747 Cyclic compositions of a positive integer n are equivalence classes of ordered partitions of n such that two such partitions are equivalent if one can be obtained from the other by rotation. These were first studied by Sommerville (1909).
%C A308747 Symmetric cyclic compositions or circular palindromes or achiral cyclic compositions are those cyclic compositions that have at least one axis of symmetry. They were also studied by Sommerville (1909, pp. 301-304).
%C A308747 Let (c(m): m >= 1) be the input sequence and let b = (b(n): n >= 1) be the output sequence under the CPAL (circular palindrome) transform of c; that is, b(n) = (CPAC c)_n for n >= 1. Hence, b(n) is the number of symmetric cyclic compositions of n where a part of size m can be colored with one of c(m) colors. If C(x) = Sum_{m >= 1} c(m)*x^m is the g.f. of the input sequence c, then the g.f. of b = (CPAL c) is Sum_{n >= 1} b(n)*x^n = (1 + C(x))^2/(2 * (1 - C(x^2))) - (1/2).
%C A308747 For the current sequence, the input sequence is c(m) = m for m >= 1, and we are dealing with the so-called "m-color" compositions. m-color linear compositions were studied by Agarwal (2000), whereas m-color cyclic compositions were studied by Gibson (2017) and Gibson et al. (2018).
%C A308747 Thus, for the current sequence, a(n) is the number of symmetric (achiral) cyclic compositions of n where a part of size m may be colored with one of m colors (for each m >= 1).
%C A308747 The function A(x) = (exp(Pi*(x + 1)*I)*phi^(-x - 4) - exp(2*I*Pi*x)*phi^(4 - x) + exp(Pi*x*I)*phi^(x - 4) + phi^(x + 4))/sqrt(5) - 2*x, where phi is the golden ratio, shows that the sequence can be easily extended to all integers. - _Peter Luschny_, Aug 09 2020
