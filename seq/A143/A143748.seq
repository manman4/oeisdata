%N A143748 Complete list of discriminants of definite Eichler orders with class number 2.
%C A143748 From Kirschmer and Voight, Table 8.3 in the arXiv version (Table 8.2 in the journal version): Definite Eichler orders with class number h = 2. A143747 is based on Table 8.2: Definite Eichler orders with class number h = 1.
