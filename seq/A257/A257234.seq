%N A257234 Levels of Narayana tree written as rows of an irregular triangle.
%C A257234 The row length sequence N (the Narayana sequence) of this irregular triangle is A000930(n+2), n >= 0.
%C A257234 This is a tree version of Pandit Narayana's cow problem (for a reference see Juschkewitsch, and references and links given in A000930). A cow is symbolized by 1 and after a year it produces a calf denoted by 0: 1 -> 1, 0.  A newborn calf remains a calf after aging one year 0 -> 0. However, if a calf becomes two years old it is symbolized by -1 because after the next year it will become a cow which has produced also a calf: -1 -> 1, 0. At level 0 (beginning of year 0) there is one cow, a 1 as root of the tree.
%C A257234 As a substitution rule with memory one takes: 1 -> 10, (1)0 -> 0, (0)0 -> -1 and -1 -> 10, where 0 is substituted depending on the number on its left, given here in brackets.The start is 1. Hence 1 -> 10 -> 100 -> 100-1 -> 100-110 -> ... . The number of symbols from {1, 0 ,-1} grows at each step by the number of 1's and -1's in the previous step.
%C A257234 The absolute row sum gives A(n) := A000930(n),which is the number of 1's and (-1)'s at level (year) n. Thus the row length N(n) = N(n-1) + A(n-1) for n >= 1.
%C A257234 The row sums give 1, 1, 1, 0, for n = 0..3, and A097333(n-4) for n >= 4.
%C A257234 The number of calves, that is, the number of 0's and (-1)'s is 0 for n = 0 and A(n+1) for n >= 1.
%C A257234 The number of -1's at level (row) n is the number of 00's in row n-1. This number is 0 for n  = 0, 1, 2, and A(n-3) for n >= 3.
%C A257234 The number of 0's at level n is N(n) - A(n) = A(n+2) - A(n) = A058278(n+2), n >= 0.
%C A257234 This is a rooted incomplete binary tree with vertices (nodes) 0 having outdegree 1, and the other vertices, 1 and -1, have outdegree 2.
%C A257234 If in the Narayana tree each branch connecting two vertices 0 is contracted, together with the two end vertices 0, to a single vertex 0 then the Fibonacci tree will result.
%C A257234 The infinite NW word (NW(n), for n -> infinity) is selfsimilar if the following decimation rules (depending on the neighborhood of the letters 10 and 0) are applied: -1 -> 0, 10 (for n >=2 always existent) -> 1 for the first 10, and if the neighbors (in brackets) are (0)10 then 10 -> 1, if (-1)10(1) then 10 -> -1 and if (-1)10(0) then 10 -> 1. If (0)0 then 0 -> 0 and if (1)0 then 0 -> 1.
%C A257234 For the first 6 levels of the Narayana tree see the W. Lang link. Narayana asked how many animals are there at level n = 20, and the answer he gave was 2745 = N(20) = A000930(22).

%F A257234 The Narayana word NW(n) over the alphabet {1, 0, -1} satisfies the Narayana recurrence  NW(n) = concatenate(NW(n-1), NW(n-3)) with input NW(0) = "1", NW(1) = "10", NW(2) = "100", NW(3) = "100-1".

%e A257234 Growth (length increase) from level 4 to 5 is 3 because level 4 has two 1's and one -1's.

%e A257234 Number of -1's at level 6: 2 = A000930(6-3).
%e A257234 Number of 0's at level 6: 7 = A000930(6+2) - A000930(6) = 13 - 6 =  A058278(6+2).
