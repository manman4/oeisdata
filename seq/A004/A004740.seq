%C A004740 This sequence is ill-defined, since there are an infinite number of cardinal numbers that start with a 'd', namely all those powers of 10 named decillion, duodecillion and so on (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_numerals). - Jasper Mulder, Jan 25 2010
%C A004740 However, it would seem then that 'billion' and 'centillion' also precede these, while it is standard (and systematic for this sequence) to refer to such numbers as 'one billion', 'one decillion', etc. - _Yasiru Ratnayake_, May 03 2012
