%N A228017 Numbers m divisible by the sum of any k-subset of digits of m with k >= 1.
%C A228017 No additional terms less than 20000000. - _T. D. Noe_, Aug 14 2013
%C A228017 Terms > 9 must be even since any pair of digits has an even subset. Since terms must also be zeroless, they cannot be divisible by 5, which means no further terms could have 5 or more digits by the Pigeonhole Principle. Therefore, this sequence is complete. - _Charlie Neder_, May 31 2019
%e A228017 48 is here because 48 is divisible by 4, 8, and 4+8.
