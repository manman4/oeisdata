%N A151567 Another version of the toothpick sequence A139250 (see Comments for definition).
%C A151567 The idea is to build a version of A139250 from four copies of the triangle in A151566 (each rotated from the previous one by 90 degrees). The result doesn't quite match A139250, however.
%C A151567 The toothpicks here have length 2, and are placed on the square grid Z X Z.
%C A151567 Place a vertical toothpick centered at (0,0) and extend it downwards to form an infinite triangle using the rule for leftist trees in A151566.
%C A151567 Place another vertical toothpick centered at (0,0) and extend it upwards to form an infinite triangle using the rule for leftist trees in A151566.
%C A151567 Place a horizontal toothpick centered at (1,0) and extend it leftwards to form an infinite triangle using the rule for leftist trees in A151566, then remove the toothpick centered at (1,0).
%C A151567 Place another horizontal toothpick centered at (-1,0) and extend it rightwards to form an infinite triangle using the rule for leftist trees in A151566, then remove the toothpick centered at (-1,0).
%C A151567 Finally, coalesce any toothpicks that have been superimposed. The result starts like A139250, but after 12 generations has fewer toothpicks.
%C A151567 The sequence gives the number of toothpicks in the n-th generation.
