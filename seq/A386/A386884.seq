%N A386884 a(n) is the number of distinct four-cuboid combinations that fill an n X n X n cube using only strict cuboids.
%C A386884 A strict cuboid is a cuboid with all three dimensions different.
%C A386884 Alternatively a(n) is the number of ways to decompose triplet (n,n,n) into sets of distinct four unordered triplets of the form (x,y,z) with x != y != z for each of the four triplets.
%e A386884 As described in A384311 there are 85 sets of distinct four-cuboid combinations filling 6 X 6 X 6 cube and only two of those have all four triplets with different elements, those are;
%e A386884    {(1,2,6), (1,4,6), (2,5,6), (4,5,6)},
%e A386884    {(1,3,6), (2,3,6), (3,4,6), (3,5,6)}.
%e A386884 Therefore a(6) = 2.
%Y A386884 Column 4 of A386903.
