%N A386593 Number of sub-relation-algebras of Re(n), the collection of all binary relations over {1,2,...,n}.
%C A386593 The first four terms are not that difficult to verify. In fact, for n < 5 the subalgebra lattice of Re(n) is the dual of the subgroup lattice of S_n. Hence a(n) = A005432(n) for n < 5.
%C A386593 Relation algebras are closed under union, intersection, complement, composition, inverse, and identity.
