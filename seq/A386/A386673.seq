%N A386673 Indices of ascending runs in a random sequence in order of increasing expected length.
%C A386673 Let L(k) be the expected length of the k-th (maximal) ascending run in a sequence of numbers drawn uniformly and independently from [0,1]. If the set {L(k) : k>=1} is sorted in increasing order, then a(n) is the index k of the n-th entry in the list.
%C A386673 The set {a(n):n>=1} consists of those k for which L(k) < 2.
%C A386673 L(k) is periodic with period approximately 5.332398 (see the formula below). Since this is close to 16/3, the sequence a(n), n>=1, exhibits long stretches of periodicity; e.g. a(n)-2*n has period 8 for 26<=n<=294.

%F A386673 If k>=2, then the expected length of the k-th ascending run is L(k) = k * Sum_{j=0..k-1} (-1)^j*(k-j)^(j-1)*exp(k-j)/j!. The expected length of the first run is L(1) = e-1.
%F A386673 The o.g.f. for L(k) is z*(1-z)/(exp(z-1)-z)-z.
%F A386673 Limit_{k->oo} L(k) = 2.
%F A386673 If z ~ 3.088843 + 7.461489i satisfies z=exp(z-1), then asymptotically L(k)-2 ~ 2*r^-k*cos(k*t), where r = |z| ~ 8.075566, and t = arg(z) ~ 1.178304 ~ Pi/2.666199.
%e A386673 min{L(k) : k>=1} = L(1) = e-1, so the first run has shortest expected length and a(1) = 1.
%e A386673 The second and third runs have second and third shortest expected length, so a(2) = 2 and a(3) = 3.
%e A386673 The fourth smallest value in the set {L(k) : k>=1} is L(7), so the seventh run has fourth shortest expected length and a(4) = 7.
