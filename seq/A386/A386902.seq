%N A386902 a(n) is the number of distinct five-cuboid combinations that fill an n X n X n with only strict cuboids.
%C A386902 A strict cuboid is a cuboid with all three dimensions different.
%C A386902 Alternatively a(n) is the number of ways to decompose (n,n,n) triplet into set of geometrically feasible distinct five unordered triplets of the form (x,y,z) with x != y != z for each of five triplets.
%e A386902 (6,6,6) triplet can be decomposed into set of five triplets in 560 different ways and only 18 of those formed by only strict cuboids. Three of those sets are given below:
%e A386902    {(1,2,3), (1,3,4), (2,3,6), (3,4,6), (3,5,6)},
