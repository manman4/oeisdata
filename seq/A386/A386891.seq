%N A386891 Irregular triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of compositions of n such that the maximal cardinality of C is k, where C is a subset of the set of parts such that all elements in C appear in weakly increasing order within the composition.
%C A386891 Here the set of parts of a composition is the set of all parts appearing in the composition.

%e A386891 The composition of n = 3 (2,1) with set of parts {1,2} has maximal subsets {1} and {2} both with all parts appearing in weakly increasing order, so (2,1) is counted under T(3,1) = 3.
%e A386891 The composition of n = 15 (3,1,1,2,3,5) with set of parts {1,2,3,5} has the maximal subset {1,2,5}, so (3,1,1,2,3,5) is counted under T(15,3) = 1115.
