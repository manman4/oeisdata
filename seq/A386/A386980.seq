%N A386980 Number of acute Heronian triangles with integer inradius n.
%C A386980 If a Heronian triangle has an inradius n, and sides (x, y, z), where x <= y <= z, then the triangle is acute iff n < (x+y-z)/2.
%C A386980 The only Heronian triangle with inradius 1 is the right triangle (3, 4, 5). Also, it has been proved that other than n = 3, all acute Heronian triangles have no prime inradii. For n = 3, the Heronian triangle has sides (10, 10, 12).
%C A386980 Empirically, it appears that the remaining occurrences of zero counts (other than 1 and the primes excluding 3) are inradii of the form 2p where p is in the set 13, 19, 29 and all other primes > 29.
%C A386980 The number of right integer triangles with inradius n is given by A078644, the number of obtuse Heronian triangles with inradius n is given by A386981 and the total number of Heronian triangles with inradius n is given by A120062.
