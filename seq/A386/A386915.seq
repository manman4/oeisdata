%N A386915 Numbers k such that k^3 - 1 is a triprime.
%C A386915 Numbers k such that either k-1 is prime and k^2 + k + 1 is a semiprime, or k-1 is a semiprime and k^2 + k + 1 is prime.
%C A386915 If k is odd, k-1 = 2*p for a prime p such that 4*p^2 + 6*p + 3 is prime.  The Generalized Bunyakovsky conjecture implies that there are infinitely many of these.
%C A386915 The Generalized Bunyakovsky conjecture also implies that there are infinitely many j such that 14*j + 3, 28*j^2 + 18*j + 3, 7*j + 2 and 196*j^2 + 154*j + 31 are all prime.  This implies that both k = 14*j + 4 and k + 1 are terms of the sequence.
%C A386915 There are no k where k, k + 1 and k + 2 are all terms of the sequence, since there are no terms == 1 (mod 3) except 4 (if k == 1 (mod 3), then k^3 == 1 (mod 9)).

%e A386915 a(3) = 15 is a term because 15^3 - 1 = 3374 = 2 * 7 * 241 is the product of three primes.
