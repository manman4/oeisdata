%N A386563 Decimal expansion of Product_{p lesser of a twin prime pair} 1/(1 - 1/p^2).
%C A386563 First 10 digits computed by Pascal Sebah.
%C A386563 Assuming the validity of the first Hardy-Littlewood conjecture on the density of twin primes, which agrees very closely with A007508, an upper bound of 1.18904882789078867...  including the contribution of the range n > 10^12 to the explicitly calculated product up to this limit can be found. Using a more realistic assumption on the distribution of twin primes between 10^(k-1) and 10^k (in calculating the bound, it was simply assumed that all twin primes between 10^(k-1) and 10^k are equal to 10^(k-1)), the value 1.18904882789077... of the product is more likely. - _Hugo Pfoertner_, Sep 03 2025
