%N A386881 a(n) is the number of occurrences of n in A386838.
%C A386881 A386838(k) is the minimal area of the graph formed under the requirement that the straight line drawn from (0,0) to (x,y) (where x^2 + y^2 = k = A001481(n)) passes through an enclosed space on the square lattice and its edges are either vertical or horizontal. If A001481(n) = x^2 + y^2 for multiple x and y, then x and y are chosen such that A386838(A001481(n)) is minimal. a(n) is the number of graphs with area n, and equivalently the number of numbers of the form x^2 + y^2 = A001481(n) such that n = x + y - gcd(x,y) for such minimal x and y.
%C A386881 The offset is 1 since 0 occurs infinitely many times in A386838 (e.g., A386838(k) = 0 when A001481(k) is square).
%C A386881 The range in which n can occur in A386838 is bounded above by 2*n^2.
%C A386881 Does every integer n > 0 appear in this sequence?
%e A386881 a(5) = 2 since 5 appears twice in A386838.
