%N A386999 Positive 2-dense triangular numbers.
%C A386999 Triangular A000217 whose divisors increase by a factor of at most 2.
%C A386999 Also these could be called 2-densely divisible triangular numbers (see A174973).
%C A386999 Also triangular numbers whose symmetric representation of sigma is a polygon. For the relationship between every edge of the polygon and the Dyck paths and the partitions into consecutive parts see A235791 and A237591.
%C A386999 Also numbers k with the property that the symmetric representation of sigma(k) is a polygon and on the axis of symmetry of the diagram the smallest Dyck path has a valley and the largest Dyck path has a peak (in this case k is also a 2-dense hexagonal number), or vice versa, the smallest Dyck path has a peak and the largest Dyck path has a valley (in this case k is also a 2-dense second hexagonal number).
%C A386999 All terms have at least a middle divisor.
%C A386999 All even perfect numbers are terms.

%e A386999 6 is a triangular number and its divisors are [1, 2, 3, 6]. The divisors of 6 increase by factors of at most 2, so 6 is in the sequence.
%e A386999 On the other hand the diagram of the symmetric representation of sigma(6) is formed by two Dyck paths described in the rows 5 and 6 of the triangle A237593, they are [3, 2, 2, 3] and [4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4] respectively. Both Dyck paths never touch, therefore the diagram is a polygon, more precisely it is a concave 12-gon of area A000203(6) = 12 as shown below, so 6 is in the sequence.
