%N A386842 a(n) is the smallest prime number p in a sequence of n consecutive primes, such that the numbers formed by the last n digits of each prime in the sequence create another sequence of n consecutive prime numbers, all strictly less than p.

%e A386842 a(2) = 131, because it is the smallest prime p such that there exists a sequence of 2 consecutive primes (131, 137), and the last 2 digits of each prime (31 and 37) are themselves consecutive prime numbers less than p.
