%N A386234 Number of good involutions of all nontrivial core quandles of order n.
%C A386234 A good involution f of a quandle Q is an involution that commutes with all inner automorphisms and satisfies the identity f(y)(x) = y^-1(x). We call the pair (Q,f) a symmetric quandle. A symmetric quandle isomorphism is a quandle isomorphism that intertwines good involutions.
%C A386234 A core quandle Core(G) is a group G viewed as a kei (i.e., involutory quandle) under the operation g(h) = g*h^-1*g. Note that Core(G) is nontrivial if and only if exp(G) > 2.

%F A386234 Let n > 2. Then Ta, Cor. 7.17 implies the following. If n appears in A000040 or A050384, then a(n) = 1. If n appears in A221048, then a(n) = 2. If n > 4 and n appears in A100484, then a(n) = 3.
%e A386234 For n = 4 the only nontrivial core quandle is the dihedral quandle R4 = Core(Z/4Z) of order 4. It is well-known (see Thm. 3.2 of Kamada and Oshiro) that R4 has exactly four good involutions. Hence a(4) = 4.
%e A386234 For n = 6 the only nontrivial core quandles are Core(S3) and R6 = Core(Z/6Z), which have one and two good involutions, respectively. Hence a(6) = 3.
