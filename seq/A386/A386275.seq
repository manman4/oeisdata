%N A386275 First term of the first occurrence of a run of exactly n consecutive terms in A072225.
%C A386275 Exactly n means the run is maximal in the sense that it has no further consecutive term before or after.
%C A386275 Prime Puzzles 798 (see links) considers where runs of consecutive terms occur in A072225 (and similar) and terms here through to n=11 are per row n=3, and extra i with g(3,i)=11, of the minimal i table by Vladimir Chirkov.
%C A386275 a(13) and beyond are > 10658896243375 = a(12).

%e A386275 For n=4, the first run of 4 consecutive terms in A072225 begins at its term 137 so that a(4) = 137,
%e A386275   A072225 = ..., 134, 137, 138, 139, 140, 144
