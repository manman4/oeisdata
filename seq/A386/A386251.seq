%N A386251 Consider the graph whose vertices are the points of the n-dimensional cubic lattice with points connected by all integer-length diagonals that traverse all n dimensions and do not intersect intermediate points. a(n) is the total length of the shortest possible closed walk in this graph via noncongruent diagonals.
%C A386251 It is provable that all such walks must be even in total length. It is also provable that 3-segment closed walks are impossible for n < 6, and conjectured that a(n) for all n >= 6 are produced by 3-segment walks.
%C A386251 For n = 2, the walk segments are the hypotenuses of noncongruent primitive Pythagorean triangles.
%C A386251 The offset is 2, because even though the graph could be defined in dimension 1 (the vertices would be the points of Z, with each point connected to its two neighbors), it would not contain any closed paths.
%C A386251 Adding a constraint that the diagonal segments must all have the same length gives A385525.

%e A386251 a(2) = 60 because [3, 4] + [5, 12] + [-15, 8] + [7, -24] = [0, 0] and segment lengths 5 + 13 + 17 + 25 = 60, which is the smallest example for n = 2.
%e A386251 a(3) = 28: [2, 2, 1] + [-3, -2, -6] + [-7, 4, 4] + [8, -4, 1] = [0, 0, 0] and 3 + 7 + 9 + 9 = 28.
%e A386251 a(4) = 20: [1, 1, 1, 1] + [-1, -2, -2, -4] + [-5, -3, -1, 1] + [5, 4, 2, 2] = [0, 0, 0, 0] and 2 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 20.
