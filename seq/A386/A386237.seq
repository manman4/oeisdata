%N A386237 Denominators of h(n) which is the minimum among the maxima of period n cycles of T(x) = 1 - 2 * |x-1/2|.
%C A386237 The fixed points of T^n are always rational of the form 2k/(2^n+-1) so the minimum among the maxima has again this property.
%C A386237 A truncated map can be formed T_h(x)=min(h,T(x)) and h(n) is the smallest h for which this map still has a period n cycle (falling between T_0 having only the fixed point 0, and T_1 which is all of T).
%C A386237 It appears that a(n)=A000225(n) for n not a power of 2 when a(n) does not simplify with the numerator.
%C A386237 It appears that a(2^n)=A000051(2^n)=A000215(n) when a(2^n) does not simplify with the denominator.

%e A386237 For n=3: the three cycles of T are {2/7,4/7,6/7} and {2/9,4/9,8/9} with maxima 6/7 and 8/9. The minimum between those last numbers is 6/7 so a(3)=7.
%e A386237 For n=4: the four cycles of T are {2/15,4/15,8/15,14/15}, {2/17,4/17,8/17,16/17} and {6/17,12/17,10/17,14/17} with maxima 14/15,16/17,14/17. The minimum between those last numbers is 14/17 so a(4)=17.
%Y A386237 Cf. A385706 (numerators).
