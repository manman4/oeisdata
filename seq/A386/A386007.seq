%N A386007 Least k such that there are exactly n primes that are popular on the interval [2,k] (see A385503); i.e., exactly n primes share the lead as the most common greatest prime factor of the numbers 2..k.
%e A386007 a(3) = 70, because the 3 primes 3, 5, and 7 all occur A385652(70) = 10 times (the maximum) as the greatest prime factor of the numbers 2..70, and for earlier intervals there is never a tie between 3 numbers.
%e A386007 a(4) = 2626355, because the 4 primes 73, 83, 109, and 113 all occur A385652(2626355) = 7634 times (the maximum) as the greatest prime factor of the numbers 2..2626355, and for earlier intervals there is never a tie between 4 numbers.
