%N A386529 Primes which remain prime after replacing 6's with 0's and 0's with 6's in their decimal representation.
%C A386529 If there are any leading 6's, they become 0's and the resulting number becomes shorter.
%C A386529 This mapping is selected since among the 10! one-to-one digit mappings (excluding the identity map) it seems to yield the greatest proportion of primes remaining prime (and by a large margin over the apparent second-best 5 <-> 8).
%e A386529 107 is a term since it's prime and 107 -> 167 remains prime;
%e A386529 613 is a term since it's prime and 613 -> 13 remains prime (leading 6 becomes leading 0).
%e A386529 101 is not a term since although it's prime, 101 -> 161 does not remain so.
%t A386529 fQ[n_] := PrimeQ[ FromDigits[ IntegerDigits[n] /. {0 -> 6, 6 -> 0}]]; Select[ Prime@ Range@ 100, fQ]
