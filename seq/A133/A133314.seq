%N A133314 Coefficients of list partition transform: reciprocal of an exponential generating function (e.g.f.).
%C A133314 The list partition transform of a sequence a(n) for which a(0)=1 is illustrated by:
%C A133314 b_0 = 1
%C A133314 b_1 = -a_1
%C A133314 b_2 = -a_2 + 2 a_1^2
%C A133314 b_3 = -a_3 + 6 a_2 a_1 - 6 a_1^3
%C A133314 b_4 = -a_4 + 8 a_3 a_1 + 6 a_2^2 - 36 a_2 a_1^2 + 24 a_1^4
%C A133314 ... .
%C A133314 The unsigned coefficients are A049019 with a leading 1. The sign is dependent on the partition as evident from inspection (replace a_n's by -1).
%C A133314 Expressed umbrally, i.e., with the umbral operation (a.)^n := a_n,
%C A133314   exp(a.x) exp(b.x) = exp[(a.+b.)x] = 1; i.e., (a.+b.)^n = 1 for n=0 and 0 for all other values of n.
%C A133314 Expressed recursively,
%C A133314 b_0 = 1, b_n = -Sum_{j=1..n} binomial(n,j) a_j b_{n-j}; which is conditionally self-inverse, i.e., the roles of a_k and b_k may be reversed with a_0 = b_0 = 1.
%C A133314 Expressed in matrix form, b_n form the first column of B = matrix inverse of A .
%C A133314 A = Pascal matrix diagonally multiplied by a_n, i.e., A_{n,k} = binomial(n,k)* a_{n-k}.
%C A133314 Some examples of reciprocal pairs of sequences under these operations are:
%C A133314 1) A084358 and -A000262 with the first term set to 1.
%C A133314 2) (1,-1,0,0,...) and (0!,1!,2!,3!,...) with the unsigned associated matrices A128229 and A094587.
%C A133314 3) (1,-1,-1,-1,...) and A000670.
%C A133314 4) A000110 and A000587.
%C A133314 5) (1,-2,-2,0,0,0,...) and (0! c_1,1! c_2,2! c_3,3! c_4,...) where c_n = A000129(n) with the associated matrices A110327 and A110330.
%C A133314 6) (1,-2,2,0,0,0,...) and (1!,2!,3!,4!,...).
%C A133314 7) Sequences of rising and signed lowering factorials form reciprocal pairs where a_n = (-1)^n m!/(m-n)! and b_n = (m-1+n)!/(m-1)! for m=0,1,2,... .
%C A133314 Denote the action of the list partition transform on the sequence a. or an invertible matrix M by LPT(a.) = b. or LPT(M)= M^(-1).
%C A133314 If the matrix equation M = exp(T) also holds, then exp[a.*T]*exp[b.*T] = exp[(a.+b.)*T] = I, the identity matrix, because (a.+b.)^n = delta_n, the Kronecker delta with delta_n = 1 and delta_n = 0 otherwise, i.e., (0)^n = delta_n.
%C A133314 Therefore, [exp(a.*T)]^(-1) = exp[b.*T] = exp[LPT(a.)*T] = LPT[exp(a.*T)].
%C A133314 The fundamental Pascal (A007318), unsigned Lah (A105278) and associated Laguerre matrices can be generated by exponentiation of special infinitesimal matrices (see A132440, A132710 and A132681) such that finding LPT(a.) amounts to multiplying the k'th diagonal of the fundamental matrices by a_k for every diagonal followed by matrix inversion and then extraction of the b_n factors from the first column (simplest for the Pascal formulas above).
%C A133314 Conversely, the inverses of matrices formed by diagonally multiplying the three fundamental matrices by a_k are given by diagonally multiplying the fundamental matrices by b_k.
%C A133314 If LPT(M) is defined differently as application of the top formula to a_n = M^n, then b_n = (-M)^n and the formalism could even be applied to more general sequences of matrices M., providing the reciprocal of exp[t*M.].
%C A133314 The group of fundamental lower triangular matrices M = exp(T) such that LPT[exp(a.*T)] = exp[LPT(a.)*T] = [exp[a.*T]]^(-1) are obtained by infinitesimal generator matrices of the form T =
%C A133314   0;
%C A133314   t(0), 0;
%C A133314   0, t(1), 0;
%C A133314   0, 0, t(2), 0;
%C A133314   0, 0, 0, t(3), 0;
%C A133314   ... .
%C A133314 T^m has trivially vanishing terms except along the m'th subdiagonal, which is a sequence of generalized factorials:
%C A133314 [ t(0)*t(1)...t(m-2)*t(m-1), t(1)*t(2)...t(m-1)*t(m), t(2)*t(3)...t(m)*t(m+1), ... ].
%C A133314 Therefore the principal submatrices of T (given by setting t(j) = 0 for j > n-1) are nilpotent with at least [Tsub_n]^(n+1) = 0.
%C A133314 The general group of matrices GM[a.] = exp[a.*T] can also be obtained through diagonal multiplication of M = exp(T) by the sequence a_n, as in the Pascal matrix example above and their inverses by diagonal multiplication by b. = LPT(a.).
%C A133314 Weighted-mappings interpretation for the top partition equation:
%C A133314 Given n pre-nodes (Pre) and k post-nodes (Post), each Pre is connected to only one Post and each Post has at least one Pre connected to it (surjections or onto functions/maps). Weight each Post by -a_m where m is the number of connections to the Post.
%C A133314 Weight each map by the product of the Post weights and multiply by the number of maps that share the same connectivity. Sum over the possible mappings for n Pre. The result is b_n.
%C A133314 E.g., b_3 = [ 3 Pre to 1 Post ] + [ 3 Pre to 2 Post ] + [ 3 Pre to 3 Post ]
%C A133314 = [1 map with 1 Post with 3 connections] + [ 6 maps with 1 Post with 2 connections and 1 Post with 1 connection] + [6 maps with 3 Post with 1 connection each]
%C A133314 = -a_3 + 6 * [-a_2*(-a_1)] + 6 * [-a_1*(-a_1)*(-a_1)].
%C A133314 See A263633 for the complementary formulation for the reciprocal of o.g.f.s rather than e.g.f.s and computations of these partition polynomials as Gram determinants. - _Tom Copeland_, Dec 04 2016
%C A133314 The coefficients of the partition polynomials enumerate the faces of the convex, bounded polytopes called permutohedra, and the absolute value of the sum of the coefficients gives the Euler characteristic of unity for each polytope; i.e., the absolute value of the sum of each row of the array is unity. In addition, the signs of the faces alternate with dimension, and the coefficients of faces with the same dimension for each polytope have the same sign. - _Tom Copeland_, Nov 13 2019
%C A133314 With the fundamental matrix chosen to be the lower triangular Pascal matrix M, the matrix MA whose n-th diagonals are multiplied by a_n (i.e., MA_{i,j} = PM_{i,j} * a_{i-j}) gives a matrix representation of the e.g.f. associated to the Appell polynomial sequence defined by e^{a.t}e^{xt}= e^{(a.+x)t} = e^{A.(x)t} where umbrally (A.(x))^n = A_n(x) = (a. + x)^n = sum_{k=0..n} binomial(n,k) a_k x^{n-k} are the associated Appell polynomials. Left multiplication of the column vector (1,x,x^2,..) by MA gives the Appell polynomial sequence, and multiplication of the two e.g.f.s e^{a.t} and e^{b.t} corresponds to multiplication of their respective matrix representations MA and MB. Forming the reciprocal of an e.g.f. corresponds to taking the matrix inverse of its matrix representation as noted above. A263634 gives an associated modified Pascal matrix representation of the raising operator for the Appell sequence. - _Tom Copeland_, Nov 13 2019
%C A133314 The diagonal of MA consists of all ones. Let MAN be the truncated square submatrix of MA containing the coefficients of the first N Appell polynomials A_k=(a.+x)^k = Sum(j=0 to k) MAN(k,j) x^j. Then by the Cayley-Hamilton theorem (I-MAN)^N = 0; therefore, MAN^(-1) = Sum(k=1 to N) binomial(N,k) (-MAN)^{k-1} = MBN, the inverse of MAN, containing the coefficients of the first N rows of the Appell polynomials B_k(x) = (b. + x)^k = Sum(j=0 to k) MBN(k,j) x^j, which are the umbral compositional inverses of the Appell row polynomials A_k(x) of MAN; that is, A_k(B.(x)) = x^k = B_k(A.(x)), where, e.g., (A.(x))^k = A_k(x). - _Tom Copeland_, May 13 2020
%C A133314 The use of the term 'list partition transform' resulted from one of my first uses of these partition polynomials in relating A000262 to A084358 with their simple e.g.f.s. Other appropriate names would be the permutohedra polynomials since they are refined Euler characteristics of the permutohedra or the reciprocal polynomials since they give the multiplicative inverses of e.g.f.s with a constant of 1. - _Tom Copeland_, Oct 09 2022
